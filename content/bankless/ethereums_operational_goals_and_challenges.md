The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has undergone a leadership transition with Tamas and Shiae stepping in as co-executive directors, marking a new chapter for Ethereum's operational strategy and future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This shift is intended to bring more operational leadership, accelerate upgrade cadences, and prioritize product mindfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The EF acts as a central coordinator and "compass" for the entire Ethereum operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

The new leadership aims to bring an "energy of experience" to build the organization and ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, focusing on internal structure and accelerating processes within the EF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. Their vision is for Ethereum to be a global neutral layer for all world transactions, winning through impact and upholding values like privacy, security, open source, and censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. Shiae emphasizes leading with clarity, moving with purpose, and building without personal attachment, aiming for the most decentralized, permissionless, and open blockchain globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

## [[Ethereum roadmap and priorities | Operational Goals]]

The new leadership has articulated three core operational goals for Ethereum's direction:
1.  **Scaling the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>: This involves strengthening the L1 to ensure it "outclasses competitors" in terms of research quality, protocol strength, decentralization, security, and throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. The goal is to achieve 3x scaling this year and 10x by next year, aiming for 100x over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.
2.  **Scaling Blobs for Layer 2s** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>: This expresses general support for the Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem, which has been a "massive success" in scaling and bringing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. The L1 will provide the anchoring layer, borrowing security and values from Layer 1, ensuring L2s can deliver expected levels of safety and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.
3.  **Improving User Experience (UX)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>: This includes addressing interoperability problems across L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>, making the L2-L1 experience feel like "one chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>, and enhancing ease of use, security, asset management, block latency, and pre-confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>. Developer experience (DevX) is also considered part of UX, ensuring builders have a great experience, tooling, roadmap clarity, and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. This implies a shift towards a "product-centric Ethereum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.

These objectives are intended to be achieved with a focus on speed of execution, accountability, clear goals, and trackable metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>.

## [[Challenges and changes within the Ethereum Foundation | Challenges and Perceived Lacking Areas]]

The Ethereum community has identified several areas where the EF has been perceived as lacking:

*   **Slowness and Lack of Acceleration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>: There's a desire for faster timelines, commitment to deadlines, and accelerated delivery of upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. Concerns existed that Ethereum might over-focus on long-term research and stop delivering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.
*   **Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>: A need for clearer and simpler communication of the roadmap and milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
*   **"Ivory Tower" Disconnection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>: A feeling that the EF is sometimes disconnected from the real-world use cases and daily experiences of DeFi users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making Capacity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>: Illustrated by the EIP 663 and EOF (EVM Object Format) debates, where years of developer effort were put into features that were ultimately removed due to changing community consensus or lack of a clear decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The "fault is about the lack of capacity to decide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.

## Strategies for Improvement

The new leadership believes these problems are "very much fixable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>:

*   **Accelerating Processes**: Small changes to communication can help significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. The EF aims to accelerate internal processes, including decision-making, by empowering team leads and giving them a stronger voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Communication**: Being more transparent and communicative, responding to questions from the media, and not avoiding difficult questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This includes simplifying the roadmap and increasing clarity for ecosystem partners like L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.
*   **Product-Centric Approach**: The EF will focus on defining "what structures within the organization address it" to include product conversation in development processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. This involves engaging users and asking for their opinions on changes, quality, and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.
*   **Empowering the Ecosystem**: Encouraging builders to act without waiting for major conferences or meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. The EF wants to activate as many people and decision-makers in the community as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>. They plan to restructure the All Core Developers (ACD) calls to include product conversation and focus on fast testing and deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.

## Upcoming Milestones and Cadence

The EF is committed to accelerating the hard fork cadence to every six months, a significant speed-up from the historical 12-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>.

*   **Pectra**: The next hard fork, planned for after May 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. It will bring changes to staking with mass effective balance and significant UX improvements via EIP 102 (related to account abstraction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:45">[01:27:45]</a>.
*   **Fuzaka**: Immediately after Pectra, devnets for Fuzaka will be spawned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>. The target is September or October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:42">[01:28:42]</a>, with efforts to accelerate its delivery and prevent delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>.
*   **Glamsterdam**: Planned for March to June next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>, with a focus on L1 scaling acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:20">[01:29:20]</a>.

## The Role of the Ethereum Foundation

The EF operates as a non-profit organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

### What the EF Does

*   **Research and Coordination**: The EF excels in research, with other chains often copying their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. They coordinate shipping major protocol changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:45]</a>.
*   **Grant Funding**: Provides grants to support initiatives in the ecosystem, especially for critical things only the EF can do directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>.
*   **Community Building**: Throws developer events, supports mentors and hackers, and coordinates resources within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Resource**: Available to answer questions and act as a knowledgeable organization for Wall Street, governments, and other institutions seeking expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.
*   **Facilitator**: Acts as a "helper" and "business developer" by connecting organizations, helping applications find customers or talent, and leveraging research for product launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.
*   **Network Creator**: Focuses on creating a social network within the ecosystem, multiplying the efforts of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Improving clarity and overall communication strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.

### What the EF Doesn't (or Rarely) Do

*   **Direct Engineering of Clients**: The EF does not build consensus layer clients (e.g., Geth, Nethermind), but they do have an execution layer client team internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:19">[01:22:19]</a>. They avoid building applications or direct infrastructure in the future, as the ecosystem is ready to handle it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.
*   **Asset Accumulation**: The community expects the EF to hold ETH, but they must sell ETH to fund operations, pay staff, and issue grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.
*   **Direct Business Development/Sales**: While the EF will be more active in a "helper" business development role, it's not directly responsible for tasks like onboarding Wall Street or conducting aggressive marketing/advertising campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.
*   **Coordination as Owners**: The EF explicitly states it is not the "owner" of the Ethereum protocol and does not act as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. Decisions are about empowering others to make them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:53">[01:21:53]</a>.

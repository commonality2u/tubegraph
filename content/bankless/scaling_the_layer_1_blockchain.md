Recent discussions within the blockchain community have centered on whether there has been a "pivot" in development priorities, specifically concerning [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | scaling the Layer 1 (L1)]] blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This focus on [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | L1 scaling]] did not appear to be a priority as recently as three to six months ago, or even a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The "Pivot" Debate

Some observers suggest that the current emphasis on [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | L1 scaling]] represents a significant change, or "pivot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, figures like Anthony Cisano contend that it is not a pivot, asserting that [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | scaling the L1]] was always an integral part of the roadmap for [[The role of layer 1 and layer 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem | Ethereum]], encompassing stages such as Merge, Surge, Scourge, Verge, and Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Reprioritization, Not Abandonment

While [[The role of layer 1 and layer 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem | Ethereum's]] extensive "100-item roadmap" always included [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | scaling the layer 1]] as a long-term objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, the "pivot" in question is the elevation of this long-term goal to the forefront of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Importance of Admitting Change

The debate over whether this shift constitutes a "pivot" or a "reprioritization" can be seen as an "ego thing," stemming from a reluctance to admit past missteps or faults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It is argued that denying a pivot by claiming it was "always on the roadmap" can be damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Admitting mistakes and changes is beneficial, and it is acceptable to acknowledge a pivot, especially when it signifies an effort to correct course and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This transparency is what the market desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

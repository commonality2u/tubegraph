Ryan Adams has returned to Bankless after a 90-day hiatus from crypto and the internet, which he describes as a "reboot" that helped him fix burnout and upgrade his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. He documented his experiences in a Twitter post titled "How a Reboot Fixed My Burnout and Upgraded My Mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

### The Crypto Hiatus: Why and How it Happened

Ryan's break was prompted by a severe burnout and a feeling of being "done" and "exhausted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. A specific trigger was the public "pitchforking" related to a Solana token, which he noted was the tenth such incident, leading to his "mental operating system" crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. He described this turning point as an "emotional margin call," where the disconnection was not on his terms but forced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

He completely disconnected from everything, canceling commitments, and letting his business partner, David Hoffman, carry the entire load of Bankless for 90 days, with no meetings, work, or engagement with opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. During this time, he wasn't confident he would return to crypto or Bankless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

His level of disconnection was profound; he heard about the Trump memecoin a week after its launch from an in-real-life friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### The Reboot: Lessons Learned and Changes Implemented

After disconnecting, Ryan had the space to diagnose what was wrong, leading to a personal "reboot" and "upgrade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. He identified three main problems and their solutions:

#### 1. Over-Online and Dopamine Addiction
Ryan realized he was "way too online," checking social media, price charts, Discord, and Telegram every 15 minutes, which acted as a "dopamine drip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.
*   **Solution**: He treated himself "like a child," deleting apps, implementing screen time limitations, and going "cold turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
*   **Effect**: After a week of feeling jittery (like detoxing from caffeine), he gained "clarity" and "quiet in the mind," and after 30 days, he could "focus" and "be present" again, combining this with daily quiet time and meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

#### 2. Lost Sense of Purpose and Narrow Definition of Wealth
He felt lost, questioning "why am I doing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. The initial motivation for Bankless – [[blockchain_and_finance | freedom]] from controlling systems like banks and centralized tech companies – had been overshadowed by being a "slave to prices" and the "scorecard" of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. His definition of wealth was too narrow, focusing almost exclusively on net worth, which he felt society imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.
*   **Solution**: He defined "enough" financially with his spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>. He read Sahil Bloom's "The Five Types of Wealth," which expanded his framework beyond just financial wealth to include time, relationships (social), mental, and physical wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.
*   **Effect**: He realized he was "completely overallocated in the financial side" and neglected the other four types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. He has since committed to working out, eating nutritiously, and investing in his immediate family and friendships that had atrophied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. He created a dashboard, goals, habits, and systems to ingrain these changes into a discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>.

#### 3. Stretched Too Thin and "Overachiever's Delusion"
Ryan felt he was doing "too many things," like having "too many browser windows open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. He identified his "overachiever's delusion" as believing: "I'm the only one who could do this," "If I don't do it, it won't get done," and "Being busy is good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.
*   **Realization**: After 30 days of his hiatus, he saw that Bankless was still functioning, podcasts were shipped, and Bankless Ventures was still backing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>. This showed him that things would not crumble without him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>.
*   **Solution**: He now operates on "energy accounting": if a task "drains more than it pays," it's delegated, automated, or deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>. He is focusing on his core areas of competence or "zone of genius": storytelling (e.g., this podcast), AI, and allocating capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>.

### Return to Bankless and Crypto Landscape

Ryan's return signifies "RSA 2" (Ryan Sean Adams 2.0), where he has "upgraded the software" after system downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.

During his absence (January 16th to his return), the crypto market experienced significant shifts:
*   ETHUSD was down 48% (from $3,400 to $1,750) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:09:00">[33:09:00]</a>.
*   Bitcoin USD was down 7% (from $100,000 to $93,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:28:00">[33:28:00]</a>.
*   Solana USD was down 30% (from $210 to $150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a>.
*   Total crypto market cap decreased from $3.6 trillion to $3 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>.
*   Bitcoin vs. Gold was down 25%, with gold on a tear due to narratives about the "end of the dollar" and "Pax Americana" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>.

Ryan observed that Ether seems to be "suffering" relative to Bitcoin and Solana, and the entire Ethereum ecosystem (L2s, DeFi tokens) is "down fairly bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>. He believes [[the_concept_of_crypto_cycles_and_market_phases | the four-year crypto cycle is broken]], leading to no global consensus on whether the market is bullish or bearish; different sectors yield different answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

#### Reflections on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Memecoins
*   **Bitcoin's Strength**: Ryan acknowledges that "old school Bitcoiners" had more foresight regarding Bitcoin's brand strength and its eventual purchase by central banks through initiatives like the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. He views Bitcoin's success as linked to its "religion" and "cult" following, with figures like Michael Saylor and David Bailey building a grassroots movement to influence the Republican party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:30:00">[38:30:00]</a>.
*   **Ethereum's Challenges**: While confident that Ether is not "over," Ryan feels it's "losing the meme game" and has fallen behind in the "global store of value reserve asset conversation narrative" compared to 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>. He believes the Ethereum community has built technically but has not built the "meme base layer," "cult," or "religion" necessary for global store of value adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>. He notes that the Ethereum "ship is turning" and is seeing "signs of life" as the L1 prioritizes itself, indicating a strategic pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>.
*   **Memecoins and Corruption**: Ryan learned about the Donald Trump memecoin and the Libra memecoin during his return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>. He questions if such "politician coins" are good for crypto, seeing them as "perfect surface area for vectors of corruption" and a "complete disaster" for the political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:00">[45:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:40:00">[47:40:00]</a>. He fears this could lead to a backlash and long-term damage to crypto's reputation, potentially chipping away at its "soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:50:00">[58:50:00]</a>. He believes the current crypto brand is "worse than it was post-FTX collapse" among neutral observers, leading him to describe his work as "Frontier Tech" rather than purely "crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:40:00">[59:40:00]</a>.
*   **Content Coins**: Regarding "content coins" on Zora, which allow users to make ERC20 tokens out of content like JPEGs or videos, Ryan, as an early investor, acknowledges the structural similarity to memecoins but notes the cultural distinction Zora aims for – optimizing for creators and quantity rather than massive market caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. He supports Zora's long-term vision of minting all internet content and its user-friendly app, which prices everything in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>. He questions the "toxic" "if it's not your bag, destroy it" mentality on Crypto Twitter, viewing the ecosystem as a "survival of the fittest" environment for tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.

### Bankless Forward
David Hoffman announced strategic shifts for Bankless:
1.  **AI/Frontier Tech Expansion**: Due to the surge of AI during Ryan's hiatus and the team's interest in it, Bankless is launching a new podcast vertical called "Limitless" for Frontier Tech, while crypto content will remain on Bankless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Renewed Ethereum Focus**: Acknowledging that Ethereum needed a "reboot" in 2023, David sees Ethereum "realigning itself to a new future" and Bankless has an opportunity to support it as its "first love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
3.  **Thumbnail Reboot**: A shift to optimize for legitimacy and "legitimate conversations" rather than just click-through rate, moving away from "stupid open-mouth face" YouTuber thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
4.  **Ryan's Return**: The primary news, with Ryan rejoining the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

Ryan is optimistic about exploring both crypto and AI as the two most exciting technologies of his lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. He is bullish on the "[[potential_longterm_trends_in_crypto_markets | non-sovereign store of value]]" narrative for Bitcoin and the "Ethereum pivot" as the most interesting stories currently unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

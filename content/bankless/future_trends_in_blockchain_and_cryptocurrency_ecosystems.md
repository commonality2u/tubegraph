## Introduction to Real Economic Value (REV)
Discussions on future trends in blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystems often revolve around how to accurately value these nascent technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. A key metric that has gained attention is "REV," or Real Economic Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. REV, in this context, refers to the total network fees and Miner Extractable Value (MEV) tips that users pay for a given network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This metric is different from "Realized Extractable Value" (REv), which is a specific term from Flashbots regarding captured MEV, and does not include base fees, which are a significant portion of Ethereum's historical REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

The discussion around REV was sparked by a tweet in early 2024, highlighting that at their all-time high prices, both Ethereum (ETH) in late 2021 and Solana (SOL) in January 2024 traded at very similar multiples to their annualized REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Both also reached their all-time highs in REV generation at those points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## REV as a Valuation and Demand Metric
REV can be viewed in two primary ways:
1.  **Value Capture Metric**: Especially in proof-of-stake networks, REV represents the value captured by the network, to which token holders are entitled in some form (e.g., through burning or dividends to stakers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This makes it analogous to a top-line revenue metric for a traditional company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
2.  **Demand Indicator**: Regardless of whether L1 tokens are considered equities, REV serves as a direct indicator of user demand, showing what users are willing to pay to use a network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. It explicitly excludes application-level fees, focusing solely on network-level fees and MEV tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

While some interpret the correlation between high asset prices and high REV as a sign of rational market behavior where price increases reflect the network making more money, others argue it's a mere correlation, as on-chain activity is naturally higher during market peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, the market is increasingly looking for signs that users are willing to pay for network usage, making REV one of several factors considered for valuing larger tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Intrinsic Value vs. Speculation
Cash flows, as reflected by REV, are argued to represent the "minimum intrinsic value" of these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Unlike assets held purely for speculative resale, assets generating cash flow provide inherent value, akin to buying Apple stock and getting returns regardless of selling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The question remains whether crypto assets will gravitate towards this baseline intrinsic value, as traditional equities tend to do over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

Current data shows that while ETH and SOL at their peaks had similar multiples to REV (around 26x), other assets like Aptos (1000x) and Avalanche (136x) trade at much higher multiples, suggesting significant growth is priced in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This highlights that REV is currently only one part of the valuation equation for Layer 1 assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Block Space Utility and Native Assets
Blockchains have both a native asset and block space, with smart contracting platforms deriving utility value from their block space, often downstream from the applications built on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. For example, Ethereum's block space is valuable due to its application ecosystem (MakerDAO, Uniswap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, and Solana's due to its applications (Pump.fun, Drift) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This utility value correlates strongly with REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

However, REV's relevance varies. Bitcoin, for instance, has zero REV but is the most highly valued cryptocurrency, indicating other factors beyond block space utility are at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. For smart contracting platforms, the concept of REV is more relevant due to the utility value of their block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Tribalism in Valuation Debates
The debate around REV is often tribal, with different communities emphasizing or diminishing its importance based on how it reflects on their preferred blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Ethereum Community**: Tends to diminish REV, arguing it doesn't fully capture Ethereum's value, which prioritizes "holding state" and long-term security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Ethereum is seen as a place to securely hold money for the longest time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.
*   **Solana Community**: More likely to emphasize REV, as Solana optimizes for "state transitions" and rapid trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. Solana is highly concerned with changing state quickly and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

This mirrors earlier debates between Bitcoin and Ethereum maximalists, where different economic models and cultural priorities led to talking past each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. The general prediction is that REV will matter more for the majority of large assets going forward, though it won't necessarily become the sole valuation metric for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. Newer blockchains are also expected to be even more REV-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

## The Future: Abstraction and Application-Centricity
A significant [[future_trends_in_ai_crypto_sector | future trend]] is the increasing abstraction away from native assets to stablecoins or other currencies within applications. While native assets like ETH or SOL currently serve as the default currency for primary on-chain activities (e.g., ETH for NFTs, SOL for [[sustainability_and_trends_in_memecoins | memecoins]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, this could change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

If chain abstraction and gas payments evolve to a point where best apps use USDC instead of ETH or SOL, it could impact the demand for native assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. However, the "medium of exchange" property of native assets remains crucial. Holding native tokens allows users to be "one click away" from new hot opportunities, generating buy pressure and potentially deflationary effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

### Real World Assets (RWAs) and Local Economies
The influx of [[market_trends_in_crypto_and_ethereum | real world assets]] onto blockchains presents another factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. While crypto-native frenzies (like NFT summer or DeFi summer) have historically boosted the native asset of the respective Layer 1, the impact of RWAs is less clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. For example, $150 billion in stablecoins coming onto Ethereum has had a "lackluster response" on the Ether asset price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

### The Role of Power Users and Abstraction Hierarchies
The ecosystem might develop hierarchies of abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. "Power users" (like developers or on-chain traders using Telegram bots) who interact directly with the chain will continue to drive excitement and momentum due to their hyper-efficient, "bare metal" interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. These users are likely to prefer native currencies due to crypto-native beliefs and execution benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Abstracted users, enjoying user-friendly UIs and multi-chain access, might interact with stablecoins on the front end, but the underlying mechanics could still be denominated in native assets, driven by the power users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

### Application-Driven Value and Infrastructure Concerns
There's a growing sentiment that the value might shift more towards applications rather than solely residing in the underlying blockchain infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Valuation**: Some believe that infrastructure tokens might be overpriced if valued purely on REV, as this doesn't capture the full picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.
*   **App Recapture of Value**: As infrastructure improves, apps will try to recapture more of the value (e.g., through more efficient AMM designs, better liquidations, or even app-specific sequencing) that currently "leaks" to the Layer 1 as MEV or priority fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. This could compress the margins of REV going back to the L1 token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>.
*   **Sustainable REV**: Future sustainable REV is likely to come from access to contentious state, priority fees, and MEV, as seen on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. High congestion (base) fees are not considered a sustainable source of demand unless there's "insane scale" (e.g., millions of TPS from AI agents doing micropayments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.

The **[[crypto_market_trends_and_token_movements | crypto market trends and token movements]]** in memecoins reflect this shift. Platforms like Pump.fun and Believe are seeing significant activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **Pump.fun**: Known for launching an "unprecedented amount of actual tokens" (e.g., 31,000 tokens in one day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. However, the success rate for these tokens is extremely low, with less than 1% reaching a Raydium pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.
*   **Believe**: Focusing on curation and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. They prioritize working with teams to integrate token burning into apps, aiming to associate the token more directly with the app's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. This represents an effort to bridge memecoins to actual utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. This approach is seen as a way to "turn the apps into cash flow buyback and burn models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

## Conclusion: An Evolving Landscape
The cryptocurrency industry is still in its early stages of figuring out how to quantify and value its assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. While REV provides an objective measure of demand and value capture, it's not the complete story. The valuation of Layer 1 assets is influenced by a complex interplay of utility, demand, market perception, and the evolving relationship between the underlying blockchain and its applications. As abstraction increases and [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | market trends]] shift towards application-centric models, the "power users" and their preferences will likely dictate the direction of exciting new developments, while the role of native assets and their associated REV will continue to be debated and refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. The journey towards robust and widely accepted valuation models is ongoing, with significant implications for [[predictions_for_2025_in_cryptocurrency | predictions for 2025]] and beyond.

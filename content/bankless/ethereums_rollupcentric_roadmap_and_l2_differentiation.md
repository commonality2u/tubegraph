## The Rollup-Centric Roadmap: A Re-evaluation
The **[[ethereums_strategic_roadmap | rollup-centric roadmap]]** for [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | Ethereum]] is considered the "right roadmap" despite some believing it was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The core issue wasn't the roadmap itself, but rather the neglect of the [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The goal is to have a [[Bitcoins rollupcentric roadmap and comparison with Ethereum | rollup-centric roadmap]] built around a very strong [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Benefits of Layer 2s (L2s)
Layer 2s provide two primary benefits:
*   **Transparent Generic Spillover Space** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>: Even with optimistic [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | L1 scaling]] (3x per year), the [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] won't immediately handle all demand, thus requiring [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.
*   **Special Purpose Layer 2s** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>: These are more differentiated [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] for specific roles or applications, such as gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. These may never look fully transparent from the user's perspective, unlike generic [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

## Defining the Problem in Ethereum
In 2025, the problem is not *if* there's an issue, but its "exact nature" and what [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum]] should do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
The main perceived problems include:
*   **ETH Price Lagging** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, which makes people "feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.
*   **Declining Activity on [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | Ethereum]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>: Less app building and fewer users, making [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum]] no longer the "obvious default platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **"Ivory Tower" Mentality of the [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum Foundation]] (EF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>: Historically, the EF has been focused on "high brow research" and not actively listening to app builders and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Lack of Product Focus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>: Not treating [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum]] as a product to serve its users (L2s, app builders, end users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Neglect of Downstream Consequences of Decentralization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>: No one was responsible for ensuring the "entire picture makes sense as a whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Lack of Growth at the [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | Ethereum]] [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>: Marginal growth is happening on non-[[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | Ethereum]] [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] blockchains like Base and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Self-Inflicted Rejection of Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>: The belief that the **[[ethereums_strategic_roadmap | rollup-centric roadmap]]** is the correct long-term strategy led to neglecting the [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] as a good product in the short-to-medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

> [!quote] The Problem
> "It's not that we're struggling with the growth, it's that we rejected the growth and that's a decision that we have to reverse like as soon as possible and with full force." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>

### Why L2 Growth Isn't Seen as Ethereum Growth
Currently, [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] are not seen as "our growth" because:
*   They don't feel like "one product" with [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | Ethereum L1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   Interoperability is not as good as it should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
*   Marketing reasons: [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] have different logos and fees may go to others, contributing to the idea that their growth isn't [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum]] growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

## Shifting Priorities and Solutions

### Scaling the [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]]
There is now broad acceptance that [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | scaling the L1]] needs to be a major focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. The goal is to avoid past mistakes of making the [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] too expensive to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.
*   **Immediate Scaling (Without Tech Changes)**: Utilizing available headroom. [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum]] has been conservative due to long-term concerns like state growth, but solutions like statelessness via ZK EVM are on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. The gas limit increased from 30 million to 36 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.
*   **Feature-Based Scaling (Glamsterdam Hard Fork)**: The next open hard fork (Glamsterdam, first half of next year) will introduce features like delayed execution and access list parallelization, enabling a gas limit of 300 million (up from current ~36 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.
*   **ZK-Based Scaling (2-3 Years Out)**: This third generation of scaling involves using ZK-proofs to make the [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] technically operate like a rollup, where block producers have high load, but verifying nodes remain lightweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. This means validator nodes can be very light and not depend on overall network throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

> [!info] Scaling Targets
> The goal is to achieve about 3x increase in [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | L1 scaling]] per year. This means 100 million gas by end of this year, 10x from current levels in the next year, and another 10x in the two years following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

> [!warning] Ideological Opposition
> In the past, there was ideological opposition to [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | scaling the L1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. This opposition is now largely gone for up to 10x scaling, with confidence in achieving more without compromising [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum]]'s core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

### Evolution of Layer 2s and L1 Services
The question shifts from "taxing" or "tariffing" [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] to "what services can the [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | Ethereum L1]] provide to its [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

The **[[ethereums_strategic_roadmap | rollup-centric roadmap]]** is viewed as correct, but it needs to be centered "around a very strong [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Seamless Interoperability**: In the short term, focus is on seamless interoperability and standards for assets flowing between [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] and [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: The long-term vision is for [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] to become so transparent that users "doesn't even notice anymore" if they're on [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] or [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2]], effectively creating "one large kind of infinite compute space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Native Interoperability Solutions**: The [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] will offer direct native interoperability solutions for [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]], fostering a "much closer symbiotic relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

### "Based Rollups" and "Native Rollups"
These emerging rollup models are seen as "much closer to truly being [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum]]" than current [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] like Arbitrum or Optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. They aim to reduce the complexity of [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2]] security models by eliminating pie slices, e.g., base rollups repurpose the [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | L1]] sequencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

> [!info] The "Product" Approach
> The focus is on offering so much value to [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] (e.g., new resources like blobs, R&D, developer resources) that it becomes "tough to rip out of your stack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. This means a mutually beneficial outcome where [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] benefit from closer interoperability and the [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum]] brand, and [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum]] benefits from tightly coupled [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

### Reducing Block Times
While [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | L1 capacity]] increases are prioritized, reducing block times is also a high priority for DeFi, MEV reduction, and tighter market maker spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.
*   **Optimistic Pre-confirmations**: These provide "great UX" by giving quick promises of transaction inclusion and outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.
*   **Finality**: This determines how quickly [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] and exchanges can interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.
*   **Time to Censorship Resistance**: Refers to how quickly other actors can include transactions, ending proposer monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.

> [!tip] Future Block Times
> Reducing slot times to ~6 seconds is a "very likely possible" medium-term goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. Further reductions to potentially 1 second are more long-term, requiring significant changes to staking and other components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. The key is to achieve these without pivoting from [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum]]'s core value of anyone being able to audit and run a node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

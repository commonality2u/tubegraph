From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Berachain has officially launched its mainnet, entering what some refer to as "Q5," a humorous nod to its extended development timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. The launch also includes an airdrop of its native Bara token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>.

## Berachain Overview

Berachain is described as a high-performance, EVM-equivalent Layer 1 blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. Its distinctive feature is its "Proof of Liquidity" consensus mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. This mechanism is similar to proof of stake, but instead of merely staking tokens, users must provide liquidity to the network to participate in securing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. This design aims to bootstrap the chain's liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>.

The chain operates on a two-token model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>:
*   **Bara**: The native gas token, comparable to Ethereum's Eth, used by validators to secure the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.
*   **BGT (Bera Governance Token)**: A soulbound governance token awarded to users who provide liquidity, for instance, through protocols like Bera Swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. BGT holders can delegate their tokens to validators, directly influencing the validators' "Boost" and associated yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. This approach attempts to address the issue of inert capital in Proof of Stake blockchains, where large amounts of staked capital might not be actively used within the DeFi ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>.

## Airdrop Details

80 million Barett tokens are being distributed to users through the airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>, which constitutes 16% of the total token allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

### Initial Valuation

In its initial six hours of trading, Bara tokens were priced around $9, resulting in a Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) of $5.3 billion and a market capitalization of $1.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>. This initial performance is considered a success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

### Market Impact and Future Outlook

The launch of Berachain, alongside other anticipated Layer 1 launches like Monad, highlights the evolving market dynamics within the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. The market for new Layer 1s is competitive, with a perception that new flows might be rotating from existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

Berachain has generated significant hype and a strong community prior to its mainnet launch, a trend increasingly seen in the industry where business development and marketing precede network launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.

[[Trumps new tariffs and global trade policy | Donald Trump]] has consistently held views in favor of tariffs for decades, dating back to the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Records from that era show him discussing his enjoyment of tariffs and his desire to impose them on other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

In the 1980s, Japan was often considered the primary foreign trading adversary, rather than China, which is the focus in more recent times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Despite the shift in specific targets, Trump's core belief in tariffs as a policy tool has remained steadfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

During his announcements, [[us_foreign_trade_policies_and_tariffs_under_trump_administration | Trump]] plainly states his preference for tariffs and his intent to implement broad, high tariffs across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Investors who have taken [[the_impact_of_donald_trumps_actions_on_markets | Trump]] at his word, rather than assuming a hidden, complex strategy, have often found this to be the correct interpretation of his actions throughout his time in public office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This consistency is highlighted by "fascinating quotes" from him in the 1980s on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.

Although many did not believe he would pursue such extensive tariff measures, [[Trumps economic policies and their impact | Trump]] has followed through on his long-standing stated intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.

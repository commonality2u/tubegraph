The "AI Rollup" podcast recently addressed the controversial launch of a new decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to the crypto AI space, known as the Accelerate DAO. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> The co-hosts, David Hoffen and Ezz, provided a candid account of the challenges and lessons learned from the DAO's initial days. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

## Launch and Mission
The Accelerate DAO was launched by Ezz and two other core contributors, Marcus and Rope. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> Its core mission is to help grow the "wonderful and wacky crypto AI space." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> The founding principles of the DAO were to discover and support the best builders, creators, and enthusiastsâ€”the future leaders of the space. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> The team aimed to assemble a capable group across various blockchain ecosystems to support builders who needed assistance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

## Regrettable Decisions and Accountability
Ezz stated that the core team took steps with the launch process that they truly regret and take full accountability for. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> Key missteps included:
*   **Lack of Vesting:** In hindsight, it was obvious that vesting for the core team and advisors should have been instilled. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   **Insufficient Community Involvement:** The team should have slowed down to ensure more community members were involved in the launch process. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

The team admitted they were overly excited to launch and underestimated the potential scale of the project, expecting a small launch during a market downturn. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a> The opposite occurred, leading to "hard lessons" regarding vesting and community distribution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>

## Bankless Ventures' Involvement and Controversy
David Hoffen, an advisor to the DAO, explained that he and fellow advisor Ryan, along with Bankless Ventures and their third General Partner Ben Lof, contributed Solana (SOL) to the DAO. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

Upon the DAO's launch, the price action of the AIC token was "pretty insane," touching a billion dollars in market cap due to speculative buying. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> A controversial decision was made by the Bankless Ventures team to sell 8% of its token supply on launch day, amounting to $65,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> This decision was made without David or Ryan's input or knowledge, and they would have never approved it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>

Upon discovering the sale via a tweet, David and Ryan immediately stepped in and re-bought the AIC token with all the proceeds from the sale, just hours later. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> Selling tokens so soon into a project's lifespan is not something they support or condone. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

## Media Narrative and Clarifications
The incident provided "material" for crypto Twitter to criticize Bankless, leading to a narrative that Bankless had built the DAO to "dump" millions of dollars onto its followers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

### Misconceptions Addressed:
*   **Conspiracy to Create DAO:** The hosts clarified that Bankless did not conspire to create the Accelerate DAO for illicit purposes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   **AI Rollup for Hype:** The AI Rollup series was not started with the sole purpose of creating hype around the Accelerate DAO. The DAO was never mentioned or promoted on any Bankless podcast prior to this segment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
*   **Bankless's Role in Elevating Ezz:** A "valid critique" acknowledged was that Bankless had a role in elevating Ezz's prominence, which indirectly helped generate hype for the DAO's launch. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> However, David and Ryan only learned about the DAO's existence five days before its launch, and Ezz and the core team had already assembled a "stacked organization" without Bankless's help. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>

Ezz emphasized that the goal of the AI Rollup series is to amplify and build up other amazing teams in the [[intersection_of_ai_and_crypto | crypto AI space]], not to focus on their own side projects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>

## Future Commitment
Despite the "dramatic start" and "bumpy road," both Ezz and David reiterated their commitment to the Accelerate DAO's original mission. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> They are taking steps to repair the damage and fulfill their vision, with exciting announcements planned. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> They stressed that this would be the first and last time the Accelerate DAO is mentioned on the AI Rollup. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>

> "We are fully committed to realizing our mission despite this bumpy start. We're going to steer the ship and correct course and kind of forge ahead." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> - Ezz

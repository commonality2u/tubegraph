The [[shift_in_focus_of_the_ethereum_tech_stack | Ethereum tech stack]] is evolving to become a very strong product, which positively impacts [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset | Ether the asset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strengthening of the product bolsters the community's focus on [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset | Ether as a commodity asset]] with a commodity-like shelling point and a [[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Strategic Approaches for Ethereum and Ether

For the Ethereum technology side, there's a need for "Vitalic Buterine style convexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This implies a need for flexibility and adaptability within the community when discussing Ethereum as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The community should strive to be adaptable, flexible, nice, and open in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

In contrast, when discussing [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset | Ether the asset]], a "concavity" approach is required, characterized by being extreme and maximalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This means being strong, unforgiving, and maximalist when referring to Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Challenge of Balancing Dual Strategies

Managing both a flexible product approach and a maximalist asset approach presents a significant challenge for the Ethereum ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The community must be able to operate in both "lanes" simultaneously, adapting to the specific context of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Context-Dependent Positioning

*   **When addressing Wall Street about [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset | Ether the asset]]**: The approach should be "maximalist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **When engaging application builders choosing a platform**: The approach must be pragmatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This dual requirement, while daunting, is essential for the future of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Relationship Between Fees and Asset Strength

[[relationship_between_ethereum_fees_and_ether_asset_strength | Ethereum with higher fees and higher burn]] mechanisms can significantly boost the strength of [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset | Ether the asset]] as a commodity money within the technology side of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This highlights the [[economic_importance_of_ether_as_an_asset | economic importance of Ether as an asset]] within the ecosystem.

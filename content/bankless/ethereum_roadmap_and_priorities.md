## The "Pivot" Debate

There is an ongoing debate regarding whether the focus on scaling Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) constitutes a "pivot" or merely a reprioritization of its existing [[ethereums_roadmap_and_upgrades | roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Some observers consider it a pivot because scaling the L1 did not appear to be a priority three months, six months, or even a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This shift in focus is seen as a significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

Conversely, Anthony Cisano argues that it is not a pivot, asserting that scaling the L1 has always been part of the [[ethereums_roadmap_and_upgrades | roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This includes phases such as Merge, Surge, Scourge, Verge, and Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Hazu's commentary suggests that while scaling the L1 was indeed always part of the [[long_term_plans_for_ethereum | long-term roadmap for Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, the "pivot" lies in bringing this long-term aspect to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Importance of Admitting Change

It is argued that the reluctance to admit this shift as a "pivot" may stem from an ego-driven desire to avoid admitting fault or being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This perspective suggests that claiming "it was always on the [[ethereums_roadmap_and_upgrades | roadmap]]" allows for saving face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

However, it is beneficial and acceptable to acknowledge mistakes and adapt strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Admitting a pivot because things were "gotten wrong" and then taking steps to "make things right" is viewed as a positive approach that the market would appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:01:02]</a>.

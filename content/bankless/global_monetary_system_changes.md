The world is currently in the midst of a transfer to a new monetary system and structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>. While Donald Trump is seen as ushering this in, it is viewed as an inevitable phase change that would happen regardless of who is in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. This shift follows three historical monetary structures since World War II: Bretton Woods, the Petrodollar, and the Petroyuan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:33">[03:47:33]</a>.

## Historical Monetary Structures

### Bretton Woods (1944)
After World War II, the United States and its allies gathered at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to economically divide the world, shutting out Russia due to ideological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:14">[04:14:14]</a>. The system centered on the U.S. economy, rebuilding allies to contain Soviet Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:01">[04:36:01]</a>. In this arrangement, participating countries pegged their currencies to the U.S. dollar, which was in turn pegged to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:57">[05:53:57]</a>. The U.S. government promised central banks gold in exchange for dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:49">[06:02:49]</a>. The U.S. financed the rebuilding of Europe and Japan, allowing Germany and Japan to achieve prosperity through exports after losing the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

John Maynard Keynes had proposed a customs union to rectify economic imbalances with capital controls or "user fees" on financial markets of surplus countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:11">[05:11:11]</a>. However, this plan was not adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:10">[05:49:10]</a>. The Bretton Woods system worked well for the U.S. and its allies, supporting the Marshall Plan and post-war Japan's recovery, until the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:40">[06:40:40]</a>.

### Petrodollar (1971)
By the 1970s, the U.S. began running very large deficits due to programs like LBJ's Great Society and the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. Foreign countries, notably France, started requesting their gold back in exchange for dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:55">[07:00:55]</a>. This led to President Nixon informing everyone in 1971 that the dollar was no longer linked to gold and would freely float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:21">[07:25:21]</a>. This marked the end of Bretton Woods and the beginning of the Petrodollar era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:02">[07:34:02]</a>.

The Petrodollar system established a link between the dollar and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:33">[08:33:33]</a>. The U.S. made a deal with Saudi Arabia, the lowest marginal cost producer of petroleum, to sell oil in dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. In return, the U.S. sold weapons to the Saudis and guaranteed their control of the Arabian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:17">[08:46:17]</a>. Countries earning these dollars were required to deposit them in U.S. banks and buy U.S. treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. Since oil was essential for the [[global_economy_work | global economy]], everyone needed dollars, establishing the dollar as the global reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:38">[09:13:38]</a>. This system was backed by U.S. military involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:10">[09:29:10]</a>.

### Petroyuan (1994)
Historically, China and India were the world's largest economies, a trend that shifted only in the last 200 years to Western European and North American dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:07">[10:31:07]</a>. In the 1980s, the oil intensity of the U.S. economy decreased, and new oil discoveries in Mexico and Alaska reduced OPEC's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:39">[11:15:39]</a>. This coincided with China's rise as a manufacturing powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:21">[11:06:21]</a>.

In 1994, under Deng Xiaoping, China overhauled its tax system and sharply devalued the yuan to make its productive capacity extremely competitive for exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:46">[12:35:46]</a>. This initiated a period of rapid economic growth in China starting in the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:16">[13:02:16]</a>. Other Asian "tigers" like Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, and South Korea followed a similar mercantilist policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. After the Asian financial crisis in the early 1990s, it became standard for exporting nations to undervalue their currencies and accumulate U.S. treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:06">[13:20:06]</a>. This ensured access to dollar-denominated commodity imports like oil and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:37">[13:37:37]</a>.

> [!INFO] Role of Treasuries
> China and other Asian exporting nations became the primary accumulators of U.S. treasuries, which served as the global reserve asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:07">[14:31:07]</a>. This system allowed Americans and Europeans to de-industrialize, financialize their economies, keep inflation low, and boost corporate profits for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. This phase lasted until roughly 2008-2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:49">[14:35:49]</a>.

The U.S. became an exporter of dollars and treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:16">[18:28:16]</a>. This global trade arrangement, where the world financed U.S. consumers who bought imported goods, created a "virtuous cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:44">[19:18:44]</a>. Corporations moved manufacturing to Asia for cheaper labor, increasing corporate profits and leading to debt-financed stock buybacks rather than building new factories in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:20">[19:28:20]</a>. This financialization enriched stock owners but led to de-industrialization and job displacement for the bottom 90% of Americans, many of whom lack a university degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:32">[19:53:32]</a>. This social discontent contributed to the election of Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>.

## The New Monetary Phase

This current period is characterized by financial repression and national capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. The previous Petroyuan system is unsustainable due to these imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>.

### Policy Shift
A key characteristic of the new phase is the U.S. moving away from treasuries as the primary global reserve asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>. This is a deliberate policy choice, driven by the belief that the post-1971 system, with U.S. Treasury bonds as the reserve asset, led to detrimental social situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. Figures like JD Vance explicitly link the "demise of America" to the U.S. going off the gold standard in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.

The political aim is to "re-industrialize America" and bring back blue-collar jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>. While the U.S. may step back from being the "world police" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>, the dollar is expected to remain the global reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>. However, the global reserve asset is shifting away from U.S. Treasury bonds towards gold or [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>. The government aims to manage this transition gradually to avoid market shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>.

### Tariffs and Capital Controls
To rectify trade imbalances, the U.S. has two main tools: tariffs (attacking the trade account deficit) or capital controls (attacking the capital account surplus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>.

*   **Tariffs:** The Trump administration initially attempted aggressive tariffs, such as a 10% tariff on all imports, 34% on China, and 20% on the EU, starting April 2nd ("Liberation Day") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>. However, this proved politically destabilizing because it led to goods inflation and didn't immediately create high-paying jobs, making citizens feel poorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. This led to a 90-day truce and a return to a 10% tariff baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:00]</a>. Tariffs are seen as effective but politically unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.

*   **Capital Controls:** The preferred method is predicted to be capital controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>. This involves taxing foreign ownership of U.S. financial assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:16:00">[30:16:00]</a>. An example is the Texas legislation banning citizens from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from buying land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>.

    > [!NOTE] Political Strategy
    > A 2% annual tax on foreign assets in the U.S. (estimated at $33 trillion) could generate about $660 billion, enough to eliminate personal income taxes for the bottom 90% of American households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:00]</a>. This is presented as a politically popular move, funded by "evil foreigners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a>.

### Consequences and the Role of Money Printing
The imposition of capital controls would inevitably lead to foreign capital exiting U.S. markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:02:00">[40:02:00]</a>. This would cause U.S. property, stock, and bond markets to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:42:00">[40:42:00]</a>. When markets go down, particularly the bond market, and volatility rises, the response is to print money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>. The Treasury, Fed, and politicians would have to create policies to provide dollars to replace the departing foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] The Trade
> The consequence of this money printing will be a significant rise in the value of gold and [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:22:00">[41:22:00]</a>. This is considered the "trade" for this [[rebalancing_of_the_global_economy_due_to_us_policies | global economic rebalancing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:29:00">[41:29:00]</a>. As the global carry trade unwinds, foreign entities will sell U.S. treasuries, property, and stocks to buy back their domestic currencies, leading to asset sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:17:00">[42:17:00]</a>.

Forcing domestics to buy government debt (e.g., pension funds allocating a percentage to treasuries) is also a potential tool, though a tax on foreign capital is considered an "easier lift" politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:00">[38:28:00]</a>.

### Future Outlook and Asset Implications
The "divorce" between China and America ("Chai America") is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[32:25:00]</a>. While some predict a dual monetary system with a U.S. block and a China block (perhaps gold-backed RMB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:26:00">[45:26:00]</a>, a more fundamental view suggests that in such an unstable environment, holding capital in gold or [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] is the safest option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:26:00">[46:26:00]</a>. These assets allow for flexibility and capital preservation without betting on either system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:31:00">[46:31:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Bonds
> There is **absolutely no reason** to own long-term government bonds in this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:35:00">[47:35:00]</a>. Those who hold them will become "regulated bag holders," unable to sell due to regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:49:00">[47:49:00]</a>. T-bills are considered a cash substitute, offering higher yields than bank deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:00]</a>.

While [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] becoming the primary reserve currency is considered "crypto fantasy land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:30:00">[49:30:00]</a> (as central banks and human civilization understand gold), [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] and gold are expected to outperform traditional assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:00">[50:50:00]</a>. Stocks may still go up, but [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] is predicted to appreciate much more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:00:00">[51:00:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Financial Repression
> Financial repression may worsen, but direct confiscation of assets like gold (as with FDR's executive order) is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:00">[52:05:00]</a>. Instead, regulators will likely mandate that fiduciary pools of capital (e.g., retirement accounts, pension funds, university endowments) hold government bonds, thereby achieving the same goal through regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:26:00">[52:26:00]</a>.

## Funding the Government and [[Global Liquidity and M2 circulation | Global Liquidity]]
Scott Bessent's job (likely the Treasury Secretary in a Trump administration) will be to sell treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07:00">[53:07:00]</a>. The main buyers will be the U.S. commercial banking system, the Federal Reserve, and U.S. retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:49:00">[53:49:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Federal Reserve Actions
> The Fed, despite public statements about fighting inflation, is already conducting "quantitative easing (QE)" in certain buckets (e.g., buying 10-year bonds) within a quantitative tightening (QT) regime to help keep yields down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:09:00">[55:09:00]</a>. Large commercial banks anticipate full QE to resume in 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>. The Fed's ultimate goal is to fund the U.S. government and preserve the empire, not necessarily to preserve the value of the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:56:00">[56:56:00]</a>. Political pressure ensures there will be no austerity measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:08:00">[59:08:00]</a>.

### Stablecoins and Treasury Purchases
Some speculate that stablecoins like Tether and USDC could become significant holders of U.S. treasuries, potentially surpassing countries like Japan and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. However, stablecoins primarily hold T-bills (short-duration bonds), which doesn't solve the government's need to sell longer-duration bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. Stablecoins represent an "exportation of dollar hegemony" by providing dollar bank accounts globally, even if governments don't fully embrace them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. For stablecoins to significantly aid Treasury sales, legislation would likely need to mandate holding long-end bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.

### Gold Revaluation
Another potential strategy to fund government spending is to revalue the U.S. Treasury's gold holdings. Currently valued at $42 per ounce, revaluing it to market price (which would be significantly higher, especially if gold prices surge due to other policies) could free up trillions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. This "wink and a nod" strategy could be used politically to justify spending for jobs and other benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>.

## Geopolitical Risks and Crypto
The "Chai America divorce" refers to the economic decoupling between the U.S. and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>. While an economic divorce is anticipated, a hot war (e.g., China invading Taiwan) is considered unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47">[01:25:47]</a>. Taiwan is already economically tied to China, and an invasion would be difficult and politically risky for China's leadership, especially due to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>. In the event of an accelerated economic war or even a hot war, capital controls would tighten faster, making non-custodial assets like [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] even more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.

### [[Global Liquidity and M2 circulation | Global Liquidity]] as an Indicator
The guiding light for [[global_macroeconomic_factors_affecting_us_markets_and_economy | crypto value]] (especially [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]]) is [[global_liquidity_and_m2_circulation | global liquidity]], defined as technology plus liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. As the technology of [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] is stable, the key factor is how many units of fiat are chasing this new store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.

Key indicators to watch include:
*   **U.S.:** Excess reserves at the Fed plus other deposits and liabilities from the banking system, which proxy bank lending and Fed-created deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. Also, treasury buybacks, which are liquidity-positive for the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>.
*   **China:** Fiscal impulse and policies of the People's Bank of China (PBC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. China is currently reticent to increase money printing due to past misallocation of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.
*   **Japan:** Bank of Japan easing policies and bond purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>.
*   **EU:** ECB policies, member country bond purchases, and banking system lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.

Authorities will change their methods and nomenclature (e.g., avoiding "quantitative easing") to prevent the public from linking money printing to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. A major risk to the money-printing thesis is a situation where authorities choose to extinguish credit through austerity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>, though this is deemed unlikely due to political incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

When the MOVE index (bond volatility index) goes above 135-140, an immediate policy response is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>. This could trigger further QE, initially balanced by MBS rolloffs, but eventually outright Treasury QE across all buckets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. This creates an "ebb and flow" of volatility and policy responses, which can lead to "nasty corrections" in crypto markets if expectations get too far ahead of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.

### Crypto Market Predictions
*   **Bitcoin:** Predicted to reach $150,000-$200,000 by summer, with a potential correction, then hitting $250,000 by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   **Ethereum:** Predicted to reach $5,000 by year-end, potentially reaching $10,000-$20,000 eventually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:26">[01:31:26]</a>.
*   **Altcoins:** An "alt season" is expected, favoring projects with demonstrable cash flows and clients rather than just emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:45">[01:31:45]</a>.
*   **U.S. Regulation:** The Trump administration is perceived as pro-crypto, aiming to make America a crypto capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>. However, current legislative efforts may primarily benefit large, centralized crypto companies like Coinbase and BlackRock by creating regulatory moats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. A more beneficial approach for wider crypto adoption would be permissionless innovation with minimal rules, similar to the early internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.

For approximately 30 to 40 years, progress in space technology remained largely stalled, leading to outdated intuitions about its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The cost per kilogram to orbit, for instance, hovered around $100,000 for about three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Exponential Progress in Space Transport
The current era is witnessing an exponential surge in space capabilities, particularly with the advent of [[future_of_space_exploration_with_spacex | SpaceX]]'s Starship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. When fully reusable, Starship is projected to reduce the cost per kilogram to orbit to roughly $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents an unprecedented 50,000x [[cost_reduction_in_space_transport | reduction in cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Beyond just cost, the amount of material that can be transported to space is also experiencing a monumental increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Previously, capacity was very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Within the next decade, it is anticipated that humanity will be able to launch a million times more material per year into space than was possible 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Transformative Impact
The combined effect of a 50,000x decrease in cost and a million-fold increase in the amount of payload sent to space is considered profoundly transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

> [!quote] Analogy to the Railroad Era
> This shift is comparable to the early railroad era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Prior to railroads, crossing America by horse-drawn carriage was a perilous journey with a high risk of death or disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Railroads revolutionized transport, enabling the easy, comfortable, and very cheap movement of extremely large quantities of goods across the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The current development is described as establishing a "railroad to space," moving from the equivalent of "horse-drawn carriages to space" to a new era of "railroad space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The advancement of [[Hardware and Software Revolutions | hardware revolutions]] often precedes and enables subsequent [[Hardware and Software Revolutions | software revolutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This relationship is considered almost a definitional point in technological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Hardware as a Precursor to Software Innovation

Significant software innovations have historically been predicated on underlying hardware developments:
*   **Mobile Computing**: The advent of the iPhone, built upon decades of progress in communications technology and chips from companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom, was essential for the creation of the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The App Store, in turn, facilitated the emergence of major companies like Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Deep Learning**: The progress made in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) over 20 years was a necessary precursor for the development and widespread adoption of deep learning technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Cloud Computing and Commodity Hardware

A prime example of hardware commoditization enabling a software paradigm shift is cloud computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The fundamental concept of cloud computing relies on the ability to consolidate numerous units of inexpensive, commodity hardware in a single location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Within this framework, distributed systems employ algorithms on top of this commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These algorithms are designed to handle failures and breakdowns in the hardware in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This approach offers a substantial cost advantage compared to businesses hosting their own hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The foundation for this model required over two decades of advancements in memory, CPUs, and other essential components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum ecosystem]] has experienced significant tension regarding the [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | role and direction of the Ethereum Foundation (EF)]], reaching a boiling point on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Vitalik Buterin has engaged directly with long-standing [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, while a "second Ethereum Foundation" was also mentioned, though details remain unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Ethereum Foundation's Announced Changes

On January 18th, Vitalik Buterin tweeted about ongoing [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_changes | large changes to the Ethereum Foundation leadership structure]], a process that has been underway for nearly a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>.

The stated [[ethereum_foundations_new_leadership_and_its_goals | goals of this change]] include:
*   Improving technical expertise within EF leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.
*   Enhancing two-way communication and ties between EF leadership and ecosystem actors (users, app developers, wallets, layer-2s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
*   Bringing in fresh talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
*   Being more actively supportive of application builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.
*   Increasing the use of decentralized and privacy technology on the Ethereum chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.

Vitalik also explicitly outlined "non-goals" to clarify what the EF will *not* be doing:
*   Executing an "ideological vibes pivot from feminized WF soy boy mentality to Bronze Age mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.
*   Aggressively lobbying regulators and powerful political figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.
*   Risking compromise of Ethereum's position as a global neutral platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>.
*   Becoming an arena for vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.
*   Becoming highly centralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

Vitalik emphasized that those seeking a different direction are welcome to start their own organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. He further clarified that he is currently the primary decision-maker for the new EF leadership team, noting that "one of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a proper board, but until that happens it's me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

## Community Reaction and Concerns

Many in the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] have been advocating for leadership changes, though the recent announcements haven't fully appeased them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. Long-standing concerns regarding the EF's transparency and opaqueness have been highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. The EF's financial reports are inconsistent (e.g., skipping 2023) and lack detailed information on headcount, specific tasks, and accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. This makes it difficult to assess the EF's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.

### Call for Market Competitiveness
Some community members desire an [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_community_reactions | Ethereum Foundation]] that operates more like a top-down organization, focusing on market competitiveness, driving KPIs, and accelerating development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. This contrasts with the EF's current perception as a research and charity non-profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The EF's Apathy
> The sentiment is that the EF is vitally important due to its billion-dollar treasury, making the suggestion for community members to "start their own Foundation" impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
>
> > "The EF has a billion dollar treasury, like that's a huge war chest and if you start a new Foundation you do not have a billion dollar treasury." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>

There is a perceived stagnation and complacency within the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] and leadership, especially in responding to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. Competitors are actively marketing against Ethereum to institutions, and the lack of top-down leadership for advocacy leaves Ethereum vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

### Disconnect from User Needs
A significant point of tension is the perceived disconnect between EF leadership's grand, utopian vision for Ethereum and the actual uses by the community and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. While Vitalik has spoken out against meme coins and DeFi speculation, these are significant activities on the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. This disconnect highlights a philosophical divide:
*   **EF's Vision:** Ethereum as a credibly neutral public good and world computer for everyone, expanding its "sphere of concern" to include future users, not just current token holders or stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. This aligns with liberal values of broad inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.
*   **Community's Desire:** A focus on current users' needs, potentially mimicking faster-moving, smaller ecosystems that prioritize their immediate token holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. This approach can lead to quicker growth and wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>.

This expansive "sphere of concern," while noble, is seen by some as contributing to stagnation, as perfect consensus across such a broad group is difficult to achieve, leading to inaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

## Leadership and Direction
The discussion also highlights the personal leadership style of Vitalik Buterin, who, while respected as an early "wartime leader," now appears to prefer writing speculative blog posts over actively steering the Ethereum roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. The community, however, is looking for a leader to "pick a future and then steer the ship in that direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.

There has been a push for individuals like Danny Ryan and Donrad to take on more executive or operational roles within the EF, possibly as Executive Director, to guide development and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. This contrasts with Vitalik's role as head of a non-profit focusing on research and core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.

> [!INFO] Desired Leadership
> Some argue for centralized control of the roadmap by highly respected technical contributors like Danny Ryan, who could bridge the gap between EF leadership and the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. This approach might involve creating committees for representation without the perfectionist nature that currently causes stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.

The outcome of these [[evolution_of_ethereum_foundation_and_leadership | changes in the Ethereum Foundation and leadership]] remains to be seen, but the internal conversations and community discussions indicate an ongoing struggle to define Ethereum's future trajectory amidst growing external competition and internal philosophical differences regarding its [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | role and scope]].

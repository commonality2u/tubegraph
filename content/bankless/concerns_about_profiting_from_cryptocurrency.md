A cryptocurrency branded by a public figure recently saw its value surge following an announcement that top holders would be invited to a dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The coin's value increased by 58% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This [[the_ethical_and_market_implications_of_meme_coins | memecoin]] had previously reached a peak value of 7535 on January 19th, before a significant inauguration, and then surged again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Public Scrutiny and Denials
The surge in value and the public figure's association with the cryptocurrency have led to concerns about potential profiteering. An interviewer suggested that the public worries about "profiting from the president" when they hear about the multi-billion dollar [[market_dynamics_and_controversies_in_crypto_tokens | market cap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The public figure denied these claims, stating, "I'm not profiting from anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. They also clarified that their involvement with the cryptocurrency began "long before the election" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The individual expressed general support for [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | crypto]], believing it is important, particularly in the context of international competition with countries like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Market Valuation Discussions
During the discussion, there was a struggle to articulate the concept of [[market_dynamics_and_controversies_in_crypto_tokens | market cap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The cryptocurrency's fully diluted valuation was noted as $12.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. It was suggested that the interviewer was attempting to "bait" the public figure into publicly stating this high valuation, such as "the Trump coin is worth $12 billion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

There was uncertainty about whether the public figure understood the concept of market valuation or simply chose not to disclose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The public figure implied a lack of concern for the specific price, stating, "It's not important to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The **Genius Act** is a landmark [[stablecoin_plans_and_legislation | stablecoin bill]] that recently passed a key preliminary vote in the US Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This legislation is a significant step in the [[regulatory_developments_in_the_united_states_impacting_the_crypto_industry | regulatory developments in the United States]] concerning digital assets.

## Objectives of the Genius Act

Senator Bill Hagerty, a proponent of the bill, stated that the Genius Act aims to modernize the American payment system and place the United States at the forefront of innovation in the digital age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Key objectives include:
*   **Preventing Offshore Innovation**: The bill seeks to ensure that financial innovation occurs within the U.S. rather than being pushed abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   **Consumer Protection**: It addresses the currently unregulated [[stablecoin_market_dynamics_and_regulatory_capture | stablecoin market]], providing protection for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **US Dollar Dominance**: The act is designed to ensure and extend the US dollar's dominance as the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Stimulating Treasury Demand**: Projections suggest that by the end of the decade, [[stablecoins_and_their_significance_in_fintech | stablecoin issuers]] in the U.S. could become the largest holders of US treasuries globally, stimulating demand for these instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Key Provisions of the Bill

The Genius Act establishes clear standards for [[development_of_stablecoins | stablecoin]] issuance within the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>:
*   **Full Backing**: [[stable_coins_and_their_market_impact | Stablecoins]] must be fully backed one-to-one by liquid assets, specifically US dollars, cash, or short-term US treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This aims to prevent scenarios like the Terra Luna collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Reserve Disclosure**: Issuers are mandated to regularly disclose their reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Bankruptcy Prioritization**: In the event of a bankruptcy, [[stable_coins_and_their_market_impact | stablecoin]] holders will be prioritized for repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **AML Compliance**: The bill mandates Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Eligible Issuers**: Banks, credit unions, and non-bank entities (which must register with a federal regulator) can be [[stablecoins_and_their_significance_in_fintech | stablecoin issuers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Prohibited Issuers**: Large tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, or Google are explicitly prohibited from issuing [[development_of_stablecoins | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This provision separates tech from finance, a strategy opposite to that pursued by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

It is noted that the bill's definition of a [[development_of_stablecoins | stablecoin]] may not prohibit the existence of decentralized stablecoins like Dai (D), which would simply not be classified as a "stable coin" under the Genius Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## Congressional Support and Opposition

The Genius Act passed a preliminary Senate vote with significant bipartisan support, 66 to 32 in favor, with 16 Democrats joining Republicans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This wide margin suggests a high likelihood of passing the subsequent "real vote" expected after Memorial Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Opposition primarily comes from politicians who favor centralized control over finance, rather than from industry players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer remained opposed to the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

Banks generally oppose the bill because [[development_of_stablecoins | stablecoins]] offer an alternative to traditional bank accounts, potentially disintermediating commercial banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. The bank lobby successfully blocked a provision that would allow [[development_of_stablecoins | stablecoin]] holders to earn yield directly from the underlying treasury assets, ensuring that stablecoin issuers retain these margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## Market Impact and Future Outlook

With [[stable_coins_and_their_market_impact | stable coins]] representing about $250 billion, or 7% of the total crypto market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, the passage of the Genius Act is expected to lead to widespread adoption by fintech companies like Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe, potentially growing the [[stablecoin_market_dynamics_and_regulatory_capture | stablecoin market]] into trillions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

The bill is seen as particularly positive for Ethereum given its dominant stablecoin base, robust DeFi infrastructure, and established institutional relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Solana is also expected to benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

The concept of [[tokenization_of_private_securities_and_its_opportunities | tokenization]] involves converting real-world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process is gaining significant traction within traditional finance (TradFi), with many institutions actively exploring or engaging with the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## TradFi's Interest in Tokenization
A survey conducted by Paradigm's policy team, polling 300 TradFi professionals, revealed that [[tokenization_of_private_securities_and_its_opportunities | tokenization]] of assets is the top area of interest in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. While [[Tokenomics and Investment | stablecoins]] have seen the most traction to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, TradFi firms are even more excited about tokenizing other types of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### Types of Assets Being Considered
*   **[[Tokenomics and Investment | Stablecoins]]**: Already a prominent example of tokenized real-world assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, with strong emphasis from TradFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **Treasuries (T-bills)**: Actively being tokenized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Stocks and Bonds**: TradFi is highly interested in tokenizing assets like stocks, bonds, and derivatives to bring traditional financial assets on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Tokenized bonds on-chain are showing early signs of significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Gold**: Meaningful amounts of tokenized gold exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Company Stock**: For example, Coinbase stock is trading tokenized on Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Motivations for Tokenization
The primary motivations for TradFi's interest in [[tokenization_of_private_securities_and_its_opportunities | tokenizing assets]] on-chain stem from the inherent properties of public blockchains:
*   **Faster Settlement Times** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>
*   **Increased Transparency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>
*   **Lower Transaction Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>
*   **Improved Efficiency** and **Reduced Manual Labor**: Traditional financial systems are often "insanely inefficient and manual," with high costs for settling and handling financial instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Humans also tend to make more mistakes than smart contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   **Atomic Settlement**: The ability to atomically settle multiple assets on-chain or across chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Size**: TradFi is attracted to public blockchains like Ethereum and Solana due to their large and growing economic activity and user bases, rather than their decentralization or neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.

## Current State and Outlook
While the "tokenize the world" narrative has been a long-standing chant in the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>, there's a strong indication that it's now becoming a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. The infrastructure has matured enough to demonstrate the theoretical benefits of blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

Institutions are not waiting for regulatory clarity, but are actively "setting up their pieces" for when regulations are clearer, anticipating a significant "land grab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. They believe DeFi will become "critically important" to their business within 15 years, indicating a shift towards inevitable integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities
*   **Regulatory Clarity**: This remains the primary bottleneck for further adoption and large-scale [[tokenization_of_private_securities_and_its_opportunities | tokenization]] beyond stablecoins and treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. Policymakers are urged to adopt policies that allow firms to build on open public infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: The ability of blockchains to handle very cheap transactions has made them more attractive to financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   **Integration with DeFi Applications**: Once assets are on-chain, the focus shifts to what can be done with them, such as using them as collateral or trading them more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Permissioned vs. Permissionless**: TradFi generally rejects the notion that private blockchains are as valuable as public, permissionless ones, due to the critical need for connectivity to public blockchain liquidity and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.
    *   **L2s and Customizability**: The rise of Layer 2 solutions (L2s) is seen as a key enabler, offering scale and allowing for customizability (e.g., private transactions, KYC-only users) while still connecting to the public backbone of L1 ecosystems like Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.
    *   **Hybrid Models**: Future DEX structures might involve hybrid models with extra logic for compliance (e.g., verified pools for institutional trading) that still interoperate with broader DeFi liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

[!NOTE]
The immense demand from traditional finance to [[tokenization_of_private_securities_and_its_opportunities | tokenize]] and put real-world assets on-chain could massively expand the market for decentralized lending and borrowing protocols, requiring new designs that can handle an arbitrary number of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

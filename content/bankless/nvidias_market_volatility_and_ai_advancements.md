The week was marked by significant market volatility, largely driven by events concerning Nvidia and the broader AI landscape, creating a chaotic atmosphere in the crypto space. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a> This external turbulence, particularly from Nvidia and politics, is anticipated to be a recurring theme for the year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>

## Nvidia's Market Performance

Nvidia experienced a dramatic market correction, shedding nearly $600 billion in market capitalization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> This 17% drop marked the largest one-day loss in US history for a single company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a> The stock initially went down 17% on Monday but then rebounded 9% the next day, indicating a market overreaction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a> While still down from its high, the rapid rebound suggests the market quickly recalibrated its view. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>

## The Impact of DeepSeek R1

The catalyst for Nvidia's dip was the unveiling of a new open-source AI model, DeepSeek R1, by a Chinese AI lab. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> DeepSeek R1 quickly reached the top of the Apple Store charts, becoming the number one application within days. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> The company claimed it took only two months and less than $6 million to build, a claim that sparked debate regarding its validity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>

### Analysis of DeepSeek R1's Cost and Implications

While the $6 million figure refers specifically to the GPU hours for the final iteration of the model, the total cost for building an AI lab, acquiring GPUs, paying salaries, and covering failed training runs likely exceeds $100 million. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a> However, this sum is still significantly less than what companies like OpenAI or Meta spend. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>

The core implication is that AI development is becoming considerably cheaper than previously thought. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a> This is positive for consumers and those building AI products, as it makes AI more accessible and deflationary. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a> Conversely, it poses a challenge for producers like Nvidia, whose revenue is tied to the high cost of AI hardware. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a> DeepSeek R1's open-source nature, including the release of intermediate models, further contributes to this deflationary trend, making advanced AI models more accessible to the public and projects like Venice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>

The emergence of efficient open-source models like DeepSeek R1 challenges the perceived "moat" of leading AI companies and hardware providers like Nvidia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a> A leaked internal Google document previously suggested there is "no moat in AI" due to the rapid progress of open-source alternatives, which quickly catch up to frontier labs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a> DeepSeek R1's performance, comparable to OpenAI's O1 at a fraction of the cost, exemplifies this trend. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a> This is seen as a positive development for [[emerging trends and companies in AI crypto | decentralized AI]] and open-source initiatives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>

### Market Reactions and Analysis

Wall Street's delayed reaction to DeepSeek R1, recognizing its implications over a weekend, highlighted market inefficiencies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a> The market's initial bearish sentiment on the overall market and risk assets due to [[Nvidias market challenges | Nvidia's market challenges]] was deemed a "huge mistake." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a> While a decline in Nvidia's stock is rational, the broader impact on other assets is not, as cheaper AI is fundamentally beneficial for most of the market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>

Jeffrey Emanuel's short case for Nvidia, published days before the stock's major dip, garnered millions of views, suggesting it played a significant role in the market's re-evaluation of Nvidia's position. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a> This article detailed why [[Nvidias market challenges | Nvidia's market challenges]] were growing, particularly if AI development became more open-source rather than relying on closed commercial models, which Nvidia prefers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>

Overall, the sentiment within the crypto community is that these [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets | AI advancements]] are a positive for the industry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> The competition between nations in AI development, leading to open-source releases, could result in more accessible and powerful AI tools for everyone. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a> This deflationary effect on AI technology is beneficial for consumers and decentralized innovation, even if it creates [[Nvidias market challenges | market challenges]] for established hardware giants. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>

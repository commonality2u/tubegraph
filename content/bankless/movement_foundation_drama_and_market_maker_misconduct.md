The cryptocurrency community recently experienced significant drama surrounding the Movement Foundation and alleged market maker misconduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This event brought to light long-suspected issues within the industry regarding opaque market maker deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## The Core Allegations

On November 27, 2024, RENTH, a shell entity, requested a loan of 5% of all MOVE tokens from the Movement Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The Movement General Council reportedly deemed these terms "possibly the worst agreement I've ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Despite this, a tweaked version of the agreement allowed Web3Port, another entity via RENTH, to borrow 66 million MOVE tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This agreement also permitted the liquidation of these tokens if the Fully Diluted Valuation (FTV) of the MOVE token reached $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The signing occurred just one day before the token went live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Key issues identified in the agreement:
*   **Dual Role of RENTH**: The entity RENTH appeared on both sides of the contract, acting as a subsidiary of Web3Port and an agent for the Movement Foundation, effectively dictating both lending terms and trading strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Perverse Incentives**: The clause allowing 50% of tokens to be dumped if the token hit a $5 billion FTV was described as a "contractually obligated pump and dump scheme" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **No Lock-up**: The 66 million tokens were immediately liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Governance Failure**: Despite red flags from the council, the deal was passed through governance and signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Timeline of the Incident
*   **November 27, 2024**: RENTH requests a loan of 5% of MOVE tokens from the Movement Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Day before token launch**: The tweaked agreement is signed, allowing Web3Port to borrow 66 million MOVE tokens with a $5 billion FTV liquidation clause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **December 9-10**: MOVE lists on Binance. Wallets connected to Web3Port (the market maker) unload the entire 66 million tokens in less than 24 hours, yielding $38 million and crashing the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Misconduct and Aftermath

Binance subsequently banned Web3Port, citing "market maker misconduct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. In response, the Movement Foundation initiated an internal review in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The $38 million confiscated by Binance was returned to the Movement Foundation, which then announced a $38 million USD buyback to repurchase the dumped tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. They also cut ties with Web3Port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

Additionally, Rushi Manch, the CEO of Movement, has been suspended, and the board is considering further governance reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. An independent audit is still underway, and U.S. regulators are reportedly gathering information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### Broader Implications and Industry Reactions
This incident exposed what many in the industry suspected: market maker deals with explicit nefarious terms were being productized and were structurally systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The revelation made it "too real" for many, leading to widespread reaction on Crypto Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

The drama occurred amidst a peculiar market sentiment, characterized by a "structural bullishness of the industry" alongside "despair on the timeline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This disparity is partly attributed to the dominance of Bitcoin and stablecoins in institutional interest, which often leaves retail investors and builders in other segments feeling undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The realization that many tokens, once seen as the "future rails of the internet," were merely "casinos" has contributed to this despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

Public figures on Crypto Twitter, some with prior knowledge, used cryptographic hashes to prove they had information about the impending drama before it unfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Kobe, for example, revealed a hash predicting Rushi Manch's removal for fraud or misconduct within 28 days, a prediction that proved correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. These actions highlighted the role of "clout" and insider information in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

Discussions also emerged about the extent of investors' knowledge of such deals. While some investors might have sensed "off vibes," many smaller investors likely did not see the explicit agreements, as these were not standard market-making contracts but "crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. The varying levels of due diligence among lead funds versus other investors also contribute to this information asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

The case has drawn parallels to other incidents like the Eclipse fallout, where funds' post-factum claims of knowledge raised questions about their responsibility to disclose material information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### Movement's Market Position
Movement was positioned as the only Move-based Layer 2, aiming to capture the "free real estate" of combining Layer 2 benefits with the Move programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Despite the scandal, the MOVE FTV valuation remained at $1.6 billion, largely due to a lack of genuine sellers beyond airdrop farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. The continued volume on the token was questioned, with the illicit market-making deals being a likely explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

Recent developments in U.S. banking regulations have signaled a shift towards a more accommodating stance for financial institutions looking to engage with crypto assets. A key event was the revocation of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 by the SEC, which had previously posed significant hurdles for banks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

## Repeal of SAB 121

The SEC effectively rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 121 (SAB 121). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a> This accounting rule previously mandated that banks treat Bitcoin and other crypto assets held for customers as liabilities on their balance sheets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a> This meant that for every $100,000 of Bitcoin a bank wished to custody, they would need an additional $100,000 in liability to back it, making it "terribly capital inefficient" to offer such a product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a> No other asset in custody was treated this way. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>

The repeal of SAB 121 was widely supported, even bipartisan, during the Biden Administration, with most, aside from Elizabeth Warren, agreeing the rule was "insane" and "ridiculous." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a> Despite this, President Biden had previously vetoed an attempt by Congress to repeal it in the last Congressional year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>

Hester Peirce, an SEC Commissioner, publicly celebrated the repeal, tweeting "Bye-bye Sab 121. It's not been fun." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a> This move is seen as a "breath of fresh air" and represents a turning of the page for the crypto industry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>

## Implications for Banks and Institutions

The revocation of SAB 121 effectively gives banks the green light to custody crypto. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a> However, it's anticipated that this change will primarily impact [[role_of_banks_in_the_crypto_and_defi_space | institutional crypto custody]] rather than directly leading to retail banks offering Bitcoin balances in customer accounts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a> For retail custody, banks would need to become comfortable with a lot of other factors, such as building their own infrastructure or partnering with third parties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>

One notable example is State Street, one of the world's largest asset custodians, which had previously intended to launch a crypto custody product but found it "impossible" due to SAB 121's capital requirements. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a> The repeal removes this significant barrier for such large financial institutions.

## Federal Reserve and Treasury Stance

Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, has also indicated that banks are "perfectly able to serve crypto customers" and that the Fed is "totally fine with that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a> This statement aligns with the repeal of SAB 121, collectively signaling a more favorable regulatory environment for [[the_impact_of_financial_institutions_signaling_readiness_to_adopt_crypto | traditional banking and crypto technology convergence]].

Furthermore, the appointment of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary is viewed as a positive development for the crypto space. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a> Bessent, with a long career at Soros Fund Management, is considered "pro-crypto," having stated that "crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a> As Treasury oversees FinCEN, its stance is crucial for [[regulation_and_its_impact_on_crypto_adoption | regulation]] and enforcement within [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | financial markets and crypto]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a> His appointment is seen as bringing a "competent" and "aggressive" private sector perspective to the role, contrasting with career bureaucrats. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>

These developments indicate a move away from policies like "Chokepoint 2.0," which aimed to restrict crypto's access to banking services. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a> The overall sentiment suggests a more supportive regulatory environment for [[possibility_of_future_crypto_banks | future crypto banks]] and broader [[role_of_banks_in_the_crypto_and_defi_space | engagement of traditional banks in the crypto and DeFi space]].

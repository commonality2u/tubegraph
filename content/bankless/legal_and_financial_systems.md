The term "Internet Financial System" (IFS) describes a new paradigm shift in global financial activity, offering a more efficient and accessible system for the world's assets and financial services to billions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Unlike existing systems that rely on siloed databases communicating over the internet, the [[internet_financial_system | Internet Financial System]] is being actively built, incorporating elements of crypto, blockchain, and DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The concept aims to bring financial services to 8 billion people, often by "bringing the chain to them" rather than requiring them to understand complex terms like blockchain or tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Current Financial Systems: A Patchwork of Siloed Databases

Current financial systems do not constitute true "internet finance"; instead, they involve finance in siloed databases that only occasionally communicate over the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Accessing a bank account online is akin to ordering a pizza via Grubhub â€“ the internet is merely a communication layer to an analog, non-open system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. In this model, databases and ledgers holding assets do not exist on the open internet, preventing universal root access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Limitations and Frictions of Current Systems

The current system of disparate, permissioned siloed servers creates significant [[limitations_of_current_internet_finance_systems | limitations of current internet finance systems]] and economic malaise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>:

*   **High Transaction Costs** Transferring assets, like Apple stock from Robinhood to Fidelity, requires communication across multiple layers and approvals, often involving well-paid financial employees and extensive paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. In less sophisticated systems, like land ownership in Guatemala, transfers can involve physical presence, lawyers, and dozens of signatures and steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. These are "well-trodden corridors" requiring human intermediation to move database entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Permissioned Entry and Innovation Barriers** Existing servers are permissioned, meaning assets cannot be updated or moved without explicit permission from the controlling entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This leads to high barriers to entry, as evidenced by the near-zero number of new FDIC-insured commercial banks since 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This calcified structure stifles innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
*   **Local Banking Oligopolies** Banking benefits from economies of scale, leading to concentrated markets where typically five largest banks control over 50% of the market share in most countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. These oligopolies act as gatekeepers, leading to "underprovisioning and overpricing" of financial services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Net Interest Margin (NIM)**: The spread between what banks borrow at and what they lend at is a key indicator of pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. In less developed financial systems, NIMs can be 5 to 10 percentage points higher, sometimes reaching 20 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. This significantly increases the cost of capital, impacting mortgages, business loans, and auto loans, leading to lower GDP, employment, and overall development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
    *   High NIMs indicate very high barriers to entry, as new competitors cannot easily disrupt the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **[[Ownership tracking in finance systems | Ownership tracking in finance systems]]** in the traditional system is fragmented. Owning startup equity often means your ownership exists only on a spreadsheet or in a lawyer's or Carta's database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Similarly, owning Apple stock on Robinhood means your ownership is recorded on Robinhood's server, not directly by Apple or any other entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. In less advanced countries, land ownership might be recorded on a physical, rolled-up map in a government office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This patchwork of siloed databases makes communication cumbersome and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## The [[Internet Financial System | Internet Financial System]]: Servers with Laws

The solution to the limitations of current systems is the [[internet_financial_system | Internet Financial System]], built upon unified, permissionless servers that adhere to a set of laws. This is what blockchains provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

*   **Servers with Laws** These are scalable servers that interact with their own laws and smart contract code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. The need for a server to follow its own laws is crucial to prevent corruption and misuse, such as double-spending or arbitrary ledger manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Satoshi Nakamoto's solution to the double-spend problem paved the way for permissionless servers with laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
*   **Smart Contracts** These are "truly magical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. The ability to put assets into a contract and have it execute logic like a vending machine unlocks immense efficiencies and design space for new applications that are impossible in traditional systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. Examples include royalty contracts for streaming payments, streaming dividends to shareholders, or bespoke capital-raising instruments like revenue-share tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.
*   **Credible Commitments** The IFS relies on the concept of credible commitments, where the system itself can reliably guarantee certain outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. This is exemplified by Bitcoin's credible commitment to a 21 million supply limit, which makes it valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. [[Ethereums role in modernizing financial infrastructure | Ethereum's role in modernizing financial infrastructure]] expanded this by allowing more open-ended credible commitments for software developers to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.
*   **Unified Database** Instead of millions of siloed servers, blockchains represent single, unified servers that unlock financial efficiency, access, and strong [[global_capital_and_property_rights | property rights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This inverts the relationship between finance and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The ability to have everything on a unified server is possible because credible commitments guarantee property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>.

## The Intersection of Blockchain and Nation-State Laws

The existence of "servers with laws" creates a complex dynamic with nation-state laws.

*   **Strength of Laws** The laws upheld by blockchains (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) are, in some ways, stronger than nation-state laws, operating at a higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. Nation-states, with all their power, cannot change the fundamental laws of a sufficiently decentralized online server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. This creates friction, as nation-states are unaccustomed to things outside their control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.
*   **Interaction with Local Laws** While contracts can be designed on-chain to break local laws (e.g., paying for illegal goods), physical presence means entities are still subject to local jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>. Governments will adapt and layer legal systems on top of the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
*   **Impact on Weak Rule of Law Countries** The majority of the world's population lives in countries with low-quality [[global_capital_and_property_rights | property rights]] (e.g., property rights scores averaging 43 out of 100, compared to 95 in the US/Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. In these regimes, property can be expropriated, cases decided by bribes, and minority shareholders have little protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.
    *   **The Mystery of Capital**: Hernando De Soto's work highlights how trillions of dollars of assets are "locked" in a shadow world due to untrustworthy legal systems, preventing their transfer or use as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. This lack of strong property rights is a primary reason for lack of wealth and financial development in many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
    *   **Phases of Blockchain Impact**:
        1.  **Digital Assets**: Bitcoin offered the first real property right for people in countries like Turkey or Nigeria in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.
        2.  **Real-World Asset Tokenization**: The US, by embracing crypto and legislating on stablecoins and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, allows global access to US property rights (e.g., Apple stock on Ethereum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. This has profound implications for saving rates, transforming deflationary local currencies to appreciating assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
        3.  **Country Adoption**: Countries with weak rule of law will have an opportunity to strengthen their own laws and property rights by using internet finance tools, such as putting land registries or company governance on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>. This can pull capital into their economies by ensuring stronger property rights than their traditional political systems have offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.
*   **US Regulatory Cooperation** The US administration's embrace of crypto, especially with pending stablecoin and RWA legislation, is a "miracle" for the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. This cooperation is crucial because it aligns with US interests to export its assets and strengthen dollar dominance globally, leading to lower capital costs and higher valuations for American companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:39">[01:12:39]</a>. This support is expected to drive the [[modernization_of_financial_markets_with_blockchain | modernization of financial markets with blockchain]] by bringing major asset classes (gold, US dollars, US debt and equity) on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

While the vision for the [[internet_financial_system | Internet Financial System]] is grand, the journey has faced challenges.

*   **Speculation and "ZIRP DNA"** The early years of crypto were marked by technology "front-running" its scalability and coinciding with a zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP) era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. This created a culture of speculation and financial nihilism, where younger generations gambled for a chance to "get out of the rat race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. This "ZIRP DNA" led to a "stalinist paradigm" of capital allocation, where narrative control, not product-market fit, drove valuations and led to misallocation of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>. Higher interest rates are now seen as a necessary "purge" to shift the industry towards building real products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>.
*   **Building Real Products and Continuous Innovation**
    *   **Protocol vs. Business**: The early ideal of immutable, inert protocols that "run themselves" has largely failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:59">[01:21:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. Today, successful protocols like MakerDAO or Uniswap are actively managed businesses that continuously innovate and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>. The market is still in a "Cambrian explosion" phase, requiring teams to constantly find and exploit new efficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:42">[01:25:42]</a>. Investors now expect continuous innovation and new products to accrue value to the original token, similar to how Amazon's AWS grew its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48">[01:27:48]</a>.
    *   **Underserved Markets**: Innovation historically goes to underserved markets first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. For blockchain, early adopters were speculators and unsavory characters due to poor UX and regulatory uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. As UX improves and regulatory barriers disappear, this demographic will become a smaller percentage of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.
*   **Token Holder Protection and [[Future potential of AI in transforming financial and social systems | Future potential of AI in transforming financial and social systems]]** The concept of "Future Key" is gaining interest, allowing conditional markets to inform governance decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:59">[01:30:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. This means if a governance proposal (e.g., Uniswap fee switch) is expected to increase token value, the market would price the "yes" outcome higher, effectively guiding the decision and providing token holder protections against issues like DAO looting or arbitrary token splits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:43">[01:32:43]</a>.
*   **Path to Adoption**: The industry has the necessary technology today for the [[internet_financial_system | Internet Financial System]] to scale and achieve mass adoption, particularly with improved user experience and a favorable regulatory environment in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. The shift from a cyclical, speculation-driven industry to one focused on global adoption will occur as it moves from less than one basis point of global financial assets to potentially 70% over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:58">[01:12:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.

A notable shift is occurring in the focus of the [[ethereum_tech_stack_development | Ethereum tech stack]], aiming for it to become a very strong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategic shift is believed to provide positive feedback to Ether, the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Ether as a Commodity Asset

Ether, as an asset, is seen as pursuing the characteristics of a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This includes having a commodity-like shelling point, a commodity-like focus, and a store of value focus from the [[ethereum_community_culture | community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The strength of Ether, the asset, is bolstered by Ethereum's robust product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Additionally, Ethereum with higher fees and increased burning mechanisms can further enhance the strength of Ether as a commodity money within its technological framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Dual Stance: Convexity vs. Maximalism

The ecosystem faces a complex challenge in maintaining two distinct stances depending on the context:

*   **For the Ethereum Product (Technology Side)**: There is a need for "convexity" in the style of Vitalik Buterin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This means the [[ethereum_community_culture | community]] needs to be flexible, adaptable, nice, and open when discussing Ethereum as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. When engaging with application builders, the approach should be pragmatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **For Ether, the Asset**: The stance must shift to "concavity," being extreme and maximalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. When discussing Ether, the asset, the [[ethereum_community_culture | community]] should be maximalist, strong, and unforgiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. For instance, when speaking to Wall Street about Ether, the approach should be "yachty maximalist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## The Community's Challenge

Balancing these two contrasting approaches is difficult for the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The challenge lies not in choosing one lane, but in operating in both lanes simultaneously and adapting the chosen stance to the specific moment and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This duality can feel daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

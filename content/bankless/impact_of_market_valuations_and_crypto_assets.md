The discussion around "REV," or Real Economic Value, has sparked significant debate in the crypto community, particularly concerning the valuation of major crypto assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. REV, in this context, refers to all network fees and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) tips that users pay for a given network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Historical Valuations and REV Correlation

Analysis has shown that both ETH and SOL, at their respective all-time high prices, traded at roughly the same multiple to their annualized REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These highs also coincided with their all-time highs in generating REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This observation presents two main interpretations:
*   **Fundamental Argument**: The market is trading rationally, and prices increased because the networks were making more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Correlation Argument**: High prices led to increased on-chain activity and user willingness to pay fees, making it a correlation rather than direct causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

It is likely that both factors play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The market is increasingly looking for signs that users are willing to pay the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Understanding REV as a Metric

REV is a key metric that captures the financial activity on a blockchain. It can be viewed in two ways:
1.  **Value Capture Metric**: In a Proof-of-Stake network, token holders are entitled to receive all REV generated, whether through burns or dividends to stakers. This makes it analogous to a top-line revenue metric for a traditional company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
2.  **Demand Indicator**: Regardless of how token holders capture value, REV explicitly measures what users are willing to pay to use a network. It does not include app-level fees (like Uniswap fees) but focuses on core network fees and MEV tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This signals real demand for the blockchain's blockspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### REV for Different Blockchains
*   **Bitcoin**: Bitcoin has zero REV as a metric, making it less relevant for its valuation, which is driven by other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Smart Contract Platforms**: For platforms like Ethereum and Solana, REV is much more relevant due to the utility value of their blockspace, which is downstream of the applications built on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## The Valuation Dilemma

The crypto industry is still nascent, and there is no universally agreed-upon method for valuing crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. While traditional finance has coalesced around models like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), crypto is still in its early stages of defining such frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Intrinsic Value and DCF
Cash flows (like REV) represent a minimum intrinsic value of an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. A DCF model suggests that an asset can be held to generate money, not just to be sold at a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. However, most large crypto assets are currently "divorced" from this DCF-based intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

### Beyond REV: The Incomplete Picture
If REV were the sole determinant, many crypto assets would appear overvalued, especially those with high multiples (e.g., Aptos at 1000x, Avalanche at 136x vs. ETH/SOL at ~26x at peak) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This suggests that REV is only one component in the complex valuation of Layer 1 assets, and other factors are currently missing from the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The market is "pricing in a lot of growth" for these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Bitcoin's valuation, despite having zero REV, highlights that other properties, like "moneyiness" or "supply sinks," are at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Ethereum, while having some REV, also possesses a "special snowflake" quality similar to Bitcoin (e.g., as a trusted long-term store of value/state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Interplay of Revenue, Demand, and Abstraction

### Native Asset as Unit of Account
High transaction demand and REV often correlate with the native asset (e.g., ETH for NFTs, SOL for memecoins) being the primary unit of account for activity on that blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The native currency is often preferred for trading and best execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Future of Abstraction and [[impact_of_macro_economic_policies_on_crypto_markets | Stablecoins]]
The future impact of chain abstraction and the increasing use of [[impact_of_macro_economic_policies_on_crypto_markets | stablecoins]] (like USDC) in transactions is a key question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. If applications use [[impact_of_macro_economic_policies_on_crypto_markets | stablecoins]] more directly, it could potentially erode the native asset's "moneyiness" properties, unless the native asset remains the denominator in underlying pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

### [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | Real-World Assets]] (RWAs)
The impact of [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | Real-World Assets]] (RWAs) coming on-chain on the local economies of native assets is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. While crypto-native fervor (like DeFi Summer or NFT Summer) has historically boosted Layer 1 assets, the effect of [[impact_of_macro_economic_policies_on_crypto_markets | stablecoins]] (a form of RWA) on Ethereum's asset price has been lackluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

## Tribalism in the REV Debate

The debate around REV often splits along tribal lines (e.g., Ethereum vs. Solana communities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Ethereum Camp**: Tends to diminish the importance of REV, arguing it doesn't fully represent their value, especially given Ethereum's focus on "holding state" and credible neutrality, rather than optimizing for fast state transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.
*   **Solana Camp**: More likely to embrace REV as a dominant valuation metric, as Solana optimizes for rapid "state transitions," trading fees, and high-speed execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

This mirrors the past debates between Bitcoin and Ethereum maxis, who eventually recognized their different economic models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

## Future Outlook for Market Valuations

While REV will likely matter more for the majority of large crypto assets going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>, it may not become the strict DCF model seen in traditional equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. New blockchains might become even more REV-focused, emphasizing speed and revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. This creates a spectrum:
*   **Bitcoin Direction**: Emphasis on supply sinks and "moneyiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.
*   **Solana Direction**: Emphasis on cash flows, DCF, and an equity-like model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

### Challenges and Predictions
*   **Volatility of REV**: Current REV numbers are volatile and may not be the best indicator of future REV, as market efficiency could compress margins for the base layer, with more value recaptured at the application layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.
*   **Congestion Fees vs. Priority Fees**: Historically, Ethereum's high REV came from congestion (base fees). Solana's REV comes from contentious state, MEV, and priority fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>. Sustainable REV is more likely to come from access to contentious state rather than high base fees, as high fees drive users away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.
*   **Application Power**: As infrastructure improves and lock-in decreases, applications will gain more bargaining power, internalizing more value that previously "leaked" to the base layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. This implies a potentially "bearish" outlook for infrastructure tokens but a "bullish" one for applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.

The ongoing evolution of the crypto market, including the rise of new launchpads like Pump Fun and Belief, continues to demonstrate [[market_dynamics_and_controversies_in_crypto_tokens | dynamic token launches]] and diverse approaches to value capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. The market is still figuring out how to quantify and value these emerging dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

The launch of an official [[trump_branded_cryptocurrency | Trump branded cryptocurrency]], a [[role_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coin]], by Donald J. Trump's official Twitter account, sparked significant discussion and market activity within the crypto space. The coin, identified by the ticker "Trump," was issued on the Solana blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

## Launch and Market Performance
The official Trump meme coin was announced via a tweet from the Donald J. Trump Twitter account on January 17th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. The announcement directed users to `getTrumpmemes.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

Upon its launch, the Trump token on Solana quickly reached an initial market cap of approximately $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. It then surged to a peak of $26 billion in market cap, with a fully diluted valuation reaching about $80 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. This represented an over 11,000% increase in 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

The choice of Solana for the meme coin's issuance contributed to a significant price pump for the Solana token itself, which increased almost 50% in a week, rising from $175 to $286 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

### Impact of Melania Coin
The subsequent announcement of a Melania meme coin, also via Twitter, appeared to negatively affect the Trump meme coin's momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Melania's coin launched at a $2 billion market cap and a $13.3 billion fully diluted valuation but quickly fell to a $600 million market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. Following the Melania coin's announcement, the Trump meme coin lost almost 50% of its market cap, and Solana's price also fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

## Public and Industry Reaction
The introduction of an official Trump meme coin caused a mixed reaction within the crypto industry. Alex Thorne, Head of Firmwide Research at Galaxy Digital, noted that people initially went through stages of disbelief, anger, and then acceptance regarding the coin's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

Donald Trump's casual comments about the meme coin during a press conference also influenced its price. He stated he didn't know much about it "except that I launched it," and when told it was worth billions, he dismissed it as "peanuts" compared to other investments, which initially caused a price drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. This relates to [[trump_and_crypto_market_cap_comments | Trump and crypto market cap comments]].

Some industry figures expressed strong disapproval. Nick Carter, a founding partner at Castline Ventures and a self-described Trump supporter, called the launch "absolutely preposterous" and described it as "plumbing new depths of idiocy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. Dave Portnoy questioned the difference between the Trump coin and other "dumb" coins, suggesting it was a "Ponzi scheme from the jump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

Despite these criticisms, some in the crypto industry viewed the Trump meme coin as aligned with Trump's business approach and potentially beneficial for crypto adoption, offering legitimacy and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

## Ownership and Transparency
A notable aspect of the Trump meme coin's structure is that a Trump-owned company holds 80% of the coin's supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. This allocation raises concerns about fair distribution, especially when compared to "fair launch" coins like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

The coin's website, `getTrumpmemes.com`, provides a disclosure page detailing the allocation schedule, stating that 200 million Trump tokens were available on day one, growing to 1 billion over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. Various groups, including "creators in CIC digital" and "public distribution," are listed with their respective allocations and release schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. Alex Thorne noted that this level of disclosure is generally positive, especially as it could encourage consumer protection measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

## Context within Trump's Crypto Endeavors
The launch of the Trump meme coin is consistent with Donald Trump's prior engagement in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. He had previously released four separate collections of NFTs and launched a DeFi protocol on Ethereum called World Liberty Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. His activities align with the broader market trend of meme coins and the development of "Creator tokens and fan tokens" as new ways for public figures to monetize and interact with their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

Alex Thorne views this as "totally on brand" for Trump, given his history of issuing branded memorabilia and his engagement with various crypto facets like NFTs, DeFi, and support for Bitcoin miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. This aligns with [[the_evolution_and_decline_of_meme_coins | the Evolution and Decline of Meme Coins]] in the broader market. The current administration has signaled a more open-minded approach to digital assets, making such developments part of a "digital golden era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.

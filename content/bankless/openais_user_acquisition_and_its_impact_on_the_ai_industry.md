OpenAI has demonstrated unprecedented user acquisition rates, significantly impacting the [[AI industry]]. This rapid growth has been driven by innovative features and has led to substantial financial revaluation.

## User Acquisition Milestones
OpenAI's initial launch of ChatGPT set a new record for user growth, acquiring 1 million users in just five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This was considered record-breaking at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

More recently, a new animation and image generation feature, colloquially termed "giblification" due to its ability to render images in a Studio Ghibli style, saw even more accelerated adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This feature allowed anyone to upload an image and apply a generalized artistic direction to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. It resulted in 1 million new users being added in a mere 60 minutes (one hour), just two days after the feature launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This represents an "insane acceleration" in user growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, causing Sam Altman to comment that GPUs were melting due to the immense demand for image inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

## Financial Revaluation
Coinciding with this user growth, OpenAI successfully closed a funding round that values the company at $300 billion, a significant increase from its previous $10 billion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This round also involved a new capital raise of $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>, which CNBC reported as the largest private tech funding round in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This demonstrates the "extremely strong" state of the [[Impact of AI on the Crypto Market | AI private markets]] despite broader macro fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## Impact on the AI Industry
OpenAI's user-facing successes, particularly with features like "giblification," highlight a trend where "vibes now overrides tech merit in the intention economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This means consumer-facing products excel at capturing attention and mind share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

However, a distinction is drawn between consumer mind share and business utility:
*   While ChatGPT has achieved widespread recognition (like "Google it," now "Chat GBT it"), it's sometimes viewed as a "low value commodification of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   In contrast, models like Google's Gemini Pro 2.5, despite receiving less public attention than the "giblification" feature, are gaining traction among API users due to their efficiency and speed, representing a "divergence between consumers and companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

OpenAI is seen as a "frontier model" for its features, particularly in everyday answers, math, reasoning, deep research, voice chat, and image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This push for consumer applications contributes to the acceleration of the [[Open Source AI and Its Implications | AI industry]] and the emergence of new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

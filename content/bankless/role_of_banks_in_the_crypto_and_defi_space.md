The relationship between traditional banking institutions and the emerging crypto and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space is complex, with current dependencies and a projected future of convergence.

## Current Relationship and Dependencies

Many major crypto and DeFi protocols currently necessitate banking relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. To convert fiat currency into on-chain assets, a traditional bank is an integral part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Companies like Robinhood operate without a banking charter, functioning as neutral platforms that partner with banks for various banking needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Reasons for traditional banking charters include connecting to systems like Fedwire and the ability to lend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Future Outlook: Convergence and Crypto Banks

It is anticipated that the worlds of traditional finance and crypto are likely to [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | converge more than diverge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This convergence is seen as mutually beneficial, incorporating positive aspects of the traditional banking system into crypto, and integrating advanced crypto technology into banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

With regulatory clarity, there is a strong [[possibility_of_future_crypto_banks | possibility of future crypto banks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These entities would operate under specific licenses, with restrictions hopefully less burdensome than an OCC national banking charter, yet still governing aspects like treasury management and reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The ideal scenario involves markets with a level playing field and robust competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The discussion around [[Valuation of L1 tokens | valuation of L1 tokens]] in the crypto space, particularly concerning [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | Real Economic Value (REV)]], highlights the nascent stage of [[evaluating_crypto_with_traditional_finance_models | crypto valuation models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The term [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]], as used in current discourse, specifically refers to the sum of network fees and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) tips paid by users on a given blockchain network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## The Spark: Correlation Between Price and REV
The recent focus on [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] was ignited by an observation that [[Ethereum | ETH]] and [[Solana | Solana]], at their all-time high prices (late 2021 for ETH and January 2024 for Solana), traded at remarkably similar multiples to their annualized [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This correlation was noted to occur at times when both networks were generating their highest [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Interpretations of the Correlation
The correlation between price and [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] prompts dual interpretations:
*   **Rational Market Hypothesis**: The market is behaving rationally, with prices increasing because the networks are generating significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This aligns with a fundamental argument for [[The Role of Fundamentals in Crypto Valuation | crypto valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Correlation due to Activity**: High on-chain activity and user payments, which drive [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]], naturally coincide with periods of high asset prices, suggesting a correlation rather than direct causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

It's acknowledged that both factors likely play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Defining REV in Valuation Context
[[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] (Real Economic Value), in this context, is distinct from "Realized Extractable Value" (REV) which relates to MEV capture and does not include base fees, a significant component of Ethereum's historical [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

For clearer understanding, [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] can be viewed in two ways:
1.  **Value Capture Metric**: In proof-of-stake networks, token holders are entitled to receive all [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] generated by the network, whether through token burns or direct payouts to stakers. This is analogous to top-line revenue for an equity holder in a traditional company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
2.  **Demand Indicator**: [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] explicitly measures what users are willing to pay to use a given network, excluding application-level fees. It represents direct network-level demand for blockspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## REV and Blockspace Utility
For smart contracting platforms, [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] is highly relevant because it reflects the utility value of their blockspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The value of platforms like [[Ethereum | Ethereum]] and [[Solana | Solana]] is downstream of the applications built on them, which drive demand for blockspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

In contrast, [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] has zero [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]], making this metric irrelevant for its valuation model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. For smart contract platforms, [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] provides insight into the "equity-like" aspect of their valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Current State of Crypto Valuation
The broader consensus is that the crypto industry is still nascent, and there is no agreed-upon method for valuing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. While traditional finance models like discounted cash flow (DCF) are influential, applying them directly to crypto assets like [[Ethereum | ETH]] or [[Solana | Solana]] is still an evolving process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Intrinsic Value and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
[[The Role of Fundamentals in Crypto Valuation | Cash flows]] (represented by [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]]) are considered a minimum intrinsic value for these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. A DCF model suggests that if an asset consistently generates cash flow, it holds value independently of its speculative resale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

However, many large crypto assets are currently "divorced" from their intrinsic value based on cash flows, often "pricing in a lot of growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. For example, while [[Ethereum | ETH]] and [[Solana | Solana]] might have similar REV multiples (around 26x at peaks), other chains like Aptos were at 1000x and Avalanche at 136x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

### The Incomplete Picture
[[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] is recognized as only one part of the valuation equation for Layer 1 assets. While it offers an objective, demand-based measure of blockspace utility, it doesn't account for other factors, such as the [[Blockchain and Finance | monetary properties]] or store-of-value aspects that are crucial for assets like [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The market is still trying to figure out these "other things" that contribute to value beyond direct cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

## Tribalism in Valuation Perspectives
The debate around [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] often splits along tribal lines, with [[Ethereum | Ethereum]]-aligned communities tending to diminish its importance and [[Solana | Solana]]-aligned communities emphasizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. This mirrors earlier debates between Bitcoin and [[Ethereum | ETH]] maxis, where differing [[economic_model_and_token_dynamics_of_berachain | economic models]] and cultural values led to talking past each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

*   **Solana's Optimization**: [[Solana | Solana]] is seen as optimizing for state transitions, trading fees, and speed, which aligns well with [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] as a valuation metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. Its emphasis is on changing state quickly and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
*   **Ethereum's Optimization**: [[Ethereum | Ethereum]], on the other hand, prioritizes "holding state" and long-term verifiability. This makes [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] less central to its valuation narrative, as its value is seen to come from other factors, potentially similar to the "special snowflake" property of [[Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

## Future of Valuation Models
The expectation is that [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] will matter more for the majority of assets, including large ones, moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. However, it's not expected that [[Ethereum | ETH]] will be valued strictly as a DCF model anytime soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. New blockchains are likely to be even more [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]]-focused, emphasizing speed and revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

The challenge for models incorporating [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] is its volatility and the need to account for future scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. Additionally, the margins of [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] captured by the L1 versus the application layer are expected to compress over time as apps become more efficient and internalize value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>.

### [[Significance of network fees and MEV in crypto value | Network Fees and MEV]] as Drivers
Historically, [[Ethereum | Ethereum]]'s high [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] was primarily from base fees due to network congestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. In contrast, [[Solana | Solana]]'s [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] has consistently come from MEV and priority fees, stemming from contentious state access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. This suggests that contentious state and priority fees might be a more sustainable form of [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV]] going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.

However, high congestion fees are not a sustainable source of demand; users will simply leave if fees are too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. The future might see a shift towards applications internalizing more of the value that currently "leaks" to the base layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. This means a move from focusing on the L1 value capture to the app-level value capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.

Ultimately, the market's assessment of a blockchain's "winning" trajectory, driven by user and developer adoption, plays a significant role in its valuation, potentially overriding strict quantitative metrics in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

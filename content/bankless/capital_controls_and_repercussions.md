The implementation of [[capital_controls_and_the_consequences_for_global_markets | capital controls]] by the United States, such as taxing foreigners, raises concerns among non-Americans about the safety of their property domiciled within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Expected Repercussions of Capital Controls

If such policies are enacted, several repercussions are anticipated:
*   **Capital Exit** Foreign capital is expected to exit U.S. shores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   **Market Decline** The S&P 500 is projected to go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Mathematically, for the U.S. to reduce its capital account surplus, foreigners must sell their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Impact on Asset Outperformance** Foreigners have historically parked trillions of dollars of export earnings into American markets, which has been the basis for the outperformance of American property, stock, and bond markets over the last 30 years compared to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. If foreigners leave, these markets must decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Government Response and Monetary Policy

Historically, when markets decline, especially the bond market, and volatility increases, money tends to be printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The direct consequence of [[capital_controls_and_the_consequences_for_global_markets | capital controls]] is that the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and politicians would be compelled to create policies to provide dollars to replace the foreign capital that is leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This replacement would involve printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Investment Implications

A rebalancing of the global economy driven by these dynamics is expected to have significant investment implications:
*   **Crypto Benefit** Such a scenario is considered beneficial for cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Asset Performance** Gold and Bitcoin are predicted to significantly increase in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The concept of wealth often extends beyond mere financial accumulation. A personal journey involved recognizing that a narrow focus on financial metrics overlooked other critical aspects of a fulfilling life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Initial Focus: Defining "Enough"

The speaker initially grappled with [[defining_financial_enough | defining "enough"]] in terms of [[defining_financial_enough | crypto wealth]] and overall financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This involved determining a specific number that would allow for personal and family aspirations without constant vigilance over financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This pursuit was driven by a love for the "game" of growing a business and investing, rather than greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The objective felt like achieving a "high score" in an arcade game, rather than acquiring flashy status symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. A key missing piece was explicitly defining "enough" with a spouse and those close to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Broadening the Definition of Wealth

Initially, the speaker's [[comprehensive_definitions_of_wealth | definition of wealth]] was too narrow, primarily equating it with net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. While net worth is a crucial component, it is also a societal imposition, often taught as the sole measure of success ("number go up") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

However, wealth encompasses several dimensions beyond just finances:
*   **Financial wealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   **Time wealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   **Relationship/Social wealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Mental wealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   **Physical wealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

### The Realization: Imbalance

Upon recognizing these varied forms of [[comprehensive_definitions_of_wealth | wealth]], the speaker realized they were "completely overallocated" in the financial aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This meant neglecting the other four crucial types of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The insight underscored the importance of a holistic approach to well-being and success.

Global M2, a measure of money supply, is a key indicator for understanding global liquidity trends. Data compiled by Ralph Paul projects these trends, noting a relationship with [[bitcoin_and_stablecoin_market_trends | Bitcoin]] movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Current Trends and Future Projections
The global M2 is currently in a "bottoming zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The past few years have seen a cycle of decreasing [[potential_changes_in_global_liquidity_and_their_implications | global monetary liquidity]] across fiat systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, a new cycle is beginning, with M2 projected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Ralph Paul conceptualizes these as four-year liquidity cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Role of Monetary Policy
A recession or American capital flight is anticipated to trigger increased money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This scenario is considered bullish for [[crypto_market_trends_and_analysis | crypto]] assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Perspective on a New Monetary Order
Ray Dalio's essay, "It's Too Late: The Changes Are Coming," highlights the impending shift to a new [[monetary_phase_changes_since_world_war_ii | monetary order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. He argues that current domestic political and international world orders are collapsing due to unsustainable fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Key issues contributing to this breakdown include:
*   **Trade Imbalances:** The need to address [[global_reserve_currency_status_and_trade_deficits | trade imbalances]], such as China's dependence on United States debt and the United States' reliance on Chinese manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

These adjustments are expected to cause economic pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. In response, there is a strong incentive for governments to print more money to alleviate suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Implications for Fiat Currencies and Crypto
The strategy of printing money to ease economic pain will likely result in a decrease in the value of fiat currencies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This outcome aligns with the long-standing Bitcoiner thesis concerning [[monetary_phase_changes_since_world_war_ii | monetary policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

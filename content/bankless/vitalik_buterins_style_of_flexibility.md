A shift in focus is occurring within the Ethereum tech stack, aiming for it to become a very strong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This development is seen to have a positive feedback loop for Ether the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Dual Focus of Ethereum

Ether as an asset is intended to function as a commodity, a commodity-like shelling point, and a store of value. This is bolstered by the strength of the Ethereum product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Higher fees and burn rates within Ethereum are expected to boost Ether's strength as a commodity money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The speaker highlights a need for "convexity Vitalik Buterin style" on the technology side of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, when discussing Ether as an asset, the approach must shift to "concavity," becoming extreme and [[maximalist_approach_for_ether | maximalist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Implications for the Community

This creates a unique tension for the [[ethereum_community_culture | community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>:
*   **For the Ethereum product**: The [[ethereum_community_culture | community]] needs to be flexible, adaptable, nice, and open in its conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **For Ether the asset**: The [[ethereum_community_culture | community]] must adopt a [[maximalist_approach_for_ether | maximalist]], strong, and unforgiving stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The challenge lies in simultaneously maintaining both perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The ecosystem must learn to operate in both "lanes," choosing the appropriate approach based on the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For instance, when engaging with Wall Street about Ether, a "Yachty [[maximalist_approach_for_ether | maximalist]]" approach is suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Conversely, when interacting with application builders seeking a platform to build on, pragmatism is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This dual responsibility is recognized as both scary and daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

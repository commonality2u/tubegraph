The launch of the iPhone by [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]] in 2006 marked a significant shift in the economic landscape. At the time of the iPhone's release, [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple's]] market capitalization was approximately $70 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Apple's Initial Perception and Growth

The prevailing economic giants were traditional industries, with [[comparison_of_apple_and_oil_companies | Exxon Mobil]] being the largest company globally, boasting a market cap of around $350 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The perceived upper limit for [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]], known for creating "toy consumer devices" considered not very serious, was estimated to be about five times its then-value, reaching the scale of the most valuable oil companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This implied that the maximum potential for a company like [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]] was to become as dominant as the oil industry, which was seen as running the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Industry Transformation and Economic Impact

However, [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]] defied these initial perceptions. In subsequent years, [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]] reached a $4 trillion market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This monumental growth was achieved by creating an entirely new industry that emerged on top of the existing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This newly forged industry proved to be worth significantly more than the traditional oil sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple's]] success demonstrated that consumer technology could not only compete with but also surpass established industries in value by fostering new economic ecosystems.

The valuation of Layer 1 (L1) blockchain tokens is crucial for investors to understand return drivers and evaluate risks against potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These tokens represent the vast majority (about 95%) of the total crypto market capitalization, which is currently north of $3 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Key L1 tokens include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Sui, and Bit Tensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>.

## Evolution of L1 Token Valuation Theories

Historically, various methods have been explored to value L1 tokens:

*   **MV=PQ (Quantity Theory of Money)**: This monetary theory focuses on money supply for payments, centering valuation on velocity (rate of spending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:19">[03:54:19]</a>. It suggests that velocity must equal price times output or nominal GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:04">[04:06:04]</a>. Popular in 2016-2017, it has since fallen out of favor for valuing L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   **Stock-to-Flow**: Popularized by Bitcoiners, this method assumes scarcity, measured by the ratio of existing supply to annual issuance, directly drives value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. It draws parallels to gold, where demand is not met with an increasing supply flow, making it price-sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. However, critics argue it "assumes infinite persistent demand" and is too supply-side focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Relative Valuation to Analog Assets**: A more current approach involves comparing L1 tokens to traditional analog assets, such as Bitcoin to gold, or other L1s to other established asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. This method considers the total addressable market (TAM) of existing assets and estimates what percentage a digital asset can capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

## Current Consensus and its Critiques

As of May 2025, the consensus among many analysts is that Bitcoin is a "special snowflake" to be valued like gold, as a [[Cryptocurrency as Global Reserve Asset | monetary store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Other L1 assets, however, are often valued based on "Rev" (Revenue) using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

### The "Rev" (Revenue) Metric

Rev measures the fees users pay to L1 validators, representing the value validators capture from transaction activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Analysts interpret this as company cash flows, feeding it into DCF models to value L1 tokens like traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

However, this approach is problematic for L1 tokens because:
*   **L1 tokens are not company shares**: They do not accrue value like company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
*   **Circular Reference**: Validators earn staking yield in the native token (e.g., ETH, SOL), not a non-native currency like USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. A traditional DCF model assumes the asset compounds a non-native asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.
*   **Valueless if Centralized**: If one entity owned the entire supply of an L1 token (e.g., ETH, SOL, BTC), its value would drop to zero because there would be no network activity or fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. This contrasts with a company, where owning all shares still means a claim on future cash flows regardless of market trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. This aligns with Metcalfe's Law, where network value increases with the square of the number of connected users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.

While Rev is a "naturally pure metric" for measuring aggregate transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:10]</a>, its conversion to dollar terms for DCF models is an "extra step that is muddying the waters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. It primarily measures the use of the L1 token for payments, missing other demand drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. Furthermore, transaction fees are expected to compress over time as blockchain networks scale, approaching zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>.

## L1 Tokens as Money: The Realized Store of Value (RSOV) Framework

L1 tokens are fundamentally money, not company shares, because they fit the precise definition of money: "any asset that's primarily used to make payments and as a store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.

*   **Payments Use Case**: L1 tokens are used for on-chain services and goods, with all transactions on these chains paid for in the native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>.
*   **Store of Value Use Case**: L1 tokens are used for [[Role of staking and DeFi in crypto valuation | staking]] (taking duration risk for yield, similar to bonds) and as a deposit asset in [[Role of staking and DeFi in crypto valuation | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>. People hoard or "huddle" these assets to store wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:32:00">[48:32:00]</a>.

### Primacy of the Store of Value Use Case

For L1 tokens, the store of value use case is argued to be "the meat of the value driver," constituting the majority of value accrued, more so than the payments use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>.

This is due to supply dynamics:
*   **Payments (Blockspace)**: The supply of blockspace expands rapidly (e.g., Ethereum's ZK dream could 100x supply) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:08:00">[34:08:00]</a>. This means demand growth for payments is met with more supply growth, which is "the enemy of price" in commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:00">[30:26:00]</a>.
*   **Store of Value (Native Token)**: The supply of the native token (e.g., ETH) inflates at a very small range (e.g., 0.5% to 2% annually for ETH, potentially deflationary when staked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>. Demand growth for the store of value use case is *not* met with more supply, leading to price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34:00">[30:34:00]</a>.

### Introducing Realized Store of Value (RSOV)

RSOV is a metric designed to track the primary drivers of store of value demand for L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:08:00">[46:08:00]</a>. It's inspired by Bitcoin's "realized cap" and acts as a "net daily inflows metric" that sums two components:

1.  **Realized value of L1 tokens staked**: This measures the aggregate cost basis of tokens that have been staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36:00">[46:36:00]</a>. When users buy and stake tokens, money flows into the network and stays there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:50:00">[53:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Realized value of L1 tokens in DeFi**: This measures the aggregate cost basis of tokens deposited into DeFi protocols (e.g., for liquidity, collateral, or yield farming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:39:00">[46:39:00]</a>. Examples include depositing Ether into MakerDAO, Uniswap, Morpho, or Pendle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:29:00">[52:29:00]</a>. This reflects "reservation demand" or the total demand to buy and hold ETH in these "supply sinks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:56:00">[52:56:00]</a>.

RSOV uses the US dollar value of the token on the day of the transaction, accumulating the "total sum monetary value that is accumulating to the layer 1 token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:07:00]</a>. It measures on-chain activity and "the fundamental activity of people moving their other currencies... into soul, into BTC, into ETH" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>.

#### RSOV vs. Market Cap

The gap between a token's market cap and its RSOV indicates how much future growth the market has priced in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. For example, if Ethereum's market cap is $350 billion and its RSOV is $120 billion, the $230 billion difference represents priced-in future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.

A high Price-to-RSOV ratio (e.g., Sui at 185x) suggests the market is making a large bet on future growth of that token's usage as a store of value, indicating it is "expensive as a store of value" based on current on-chain analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. Conversely, a low ratio might indicate undervaluation.

#### RSOV and Rev Interplay

Rev (transaction fees) can influence RSOV: higher Rev often leads to higher staking yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>. When validators or users compound their native token earnings from Rev, the realized value of staked tokens increases, contributing to RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:06:11]</a>. Thus, "Rev grows RSOV one block at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>. This highlights that "soul is money [and] the reserve asset for the memecoin economy" on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>, similar to how Ether was money for the NFT economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.

#### Drivers of RSOV Growth

*   **Inflows into staking**: Driven by higher staking yields or a changing market perception of the asset's risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
*   **Inflows into DeFi**: More usage of the L1 asset as a deposit asset for collateral or liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.
*   **Growing asset issuance across the network**: More other assets (e.g., [[Stablecoins advantages over traditional banking systems | stablecoins]], tokenized Bitcoin) available on-chain for pairing with the L1 token in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>.
*   **Monetary Attributes**: Reliable issuance policy, hardened protocol rules, and easy-to-verify chains enhance the appeal of digital crypto money relative to analog government money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.

## Total Addressable Market for Digital Non-Sovereign Money

Recognizing L1 tokens as money reveals an exciting total addressable market (TAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Comparing digital crypto money (L1 tokens like Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Tao) to analog and government base money (gold, fiat currencies) shows a potential for "20x upside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>. The current digital crypto money market cap is approximately $2.5 trillion, compared to $45 trillion in analog and government-based money (gold + physically printed cash and real bank reserves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

Bitcoin is seen as a "Trojan horse" in this transition, leading the wave of demand for non-government money due to its perceived immutability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. However, other L1 crypto assets like Ethereum are argued to be "more reliable, less counterparty dependent, [and] human dependent monetary systems" due to their digital, programmatic, transparent, and autonomous nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

### Implications for Valuing Ethereum

[[Ethereums identity as a store of value | Ethereum's identity as a store of value]] is significant. While some may see [[Ethereum as a store of value and meme culture | its role in NFT and memecoin manias]] as fleeting, these frenzies still represent inflows of dollars into the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>. The question of [[Ethereum as a store of value versus a cash flow asset | Ethereum as a store of value versus a cash flow asset]] is a central debate, with the RSOV framework favoring its monetary properties.

## Conclusion: A New Framework for a New Asset Class

The RSOV framework suggests that all L1 tokens accrue value similarly: through people selling other currencies (e.g., dollars) to buy and hold the token long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This provides a fundamental, data-driven approach to valuing these assets based on their actual usage as money, rather than trying to fit them into traditional equity valuation models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:45">[01:33:45]</a>. It enables analysts to develop a forward view on potential investments by understanding what is currently priced in versus what is being driven by fundamental value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

Traditional investors should recognize that many traditional assets (like gold, oil, fiat currencies) cannot be valued using DCF models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>. L1 tokens fall into this category, requiring a framework that understands their monetary function and the network effects that drive their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:11">[01:34:11]</a>.

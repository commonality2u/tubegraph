From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

[[Donald Trumps cryptocurrency | Donald Trump]], branded as the "first pro-crypto president," is expected to initiate significant changes in the cryptocurrency landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The crypto community is keenly watching to see what actions he will take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Market Reaction
Since the announcement of [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump's]] potential pro-crypto stance, certain assets have seen notable increases:
*   XRP was up significantly on the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Its fully diluted value was estimated to be within 16% of flipping Ether's market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This boost is attributed to [[The impact of Donald Trumps actions on markets | Trump's]] receptiveness to promoting US-domiciled crypto companies, which benefits centralized organizations like Ripple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   Hedera Hashgraph, a US-domiciled company based in Dallas, Texas, also saw significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Policy Expectations and Cabinet Appointments

### Executive Actions
[[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump's]] administration is expected to make several key moves:
*   **Dismissal of Frivolous SEC Cases**: It is anticipated that the new administration will dismiss cases brought by the SEC against US-based crypto companies like Uniswap, Kraken, Coinbase, and Robinhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. This is expected to effectively "command Z" on previous SEC actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Repeal of SAB 121**: There is an expectation that [[trumps_economic_policies_and_their_impact | Trump]] will repeal Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) on day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. SAB 121 currently prevents US banks from custodying crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This repeal was previously vetoed by the Biden administration but could be reversed by [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
*   **[[Trumps crypto strategic reserve announcement | American First Strategic Reserve]]**: There is speculation about an [[trumps_crypto_strategic_reserve_announcement | "American First Strategic Reserve"]] that could prioritize digital coins founded in the US, such as Solana, USDC, and Ripple's XRP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. This idea is causing some controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>, but [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump]] is reportedly receptive to it after meeting with founders of these coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.
*   **[[Trumps crypto executive order | Pro-Crypto Executive Orders]]**: While specific details are in the rumor phase, [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump]] is expected to issue executive orders favoring crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

### Cabinet and Regulatory Appointments
The composition of [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump's]] cabinet and regulatory agencies indicates a pro-crypto shift:
*   **Treasury Secretary**: Scott Bessent, a major donor and economic advisor to [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump's]] 2024 campaign, is a likely nominee for Treasury Secretary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. He has described digital assets as "integral to economic freedom and innovation" and believes "the crypto economy is here to stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.
*   **SEC Chair**: Paul Atkins is the hopeful nominee for SEC chair, with widespread Republican support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. In the interim, Hester Peirce or Mark Uyeda are expected to serve as acting chairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. These individuals are poised to kickstart a crypto overhaul, including new regulations and freezing some enforcement actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>.
*   **CFTC Chair**: While a name hasn't been picked, Republican Commissioners Caroline Pham or Summer Mersinger are expected to head the agency in the interim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. Former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz is also on the short list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
*   **Secretary of Commerce**: Howard Lutnick, Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald (which acquired a 5% stake in Tether), is the nominee for Secretary of Commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.

### Legislative Changes
With Republicans taking over the Senate and House, legislative progress is also anticipated:
*   **Digital Assets Subcommittee**: Representative Tom Emmer has been appointed as the Vice Chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. He aims to ensure the future of digital assets is guided by "Americans with American values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.
*   **Priorities**: Emmer's vision for 2025 includes prioritizing market structure frameworks like FIT21, restrictions on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and promoting global dollar-backed stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.
*   **Key Legislation**: Hopes for key legislation, including stablecoin legislation and clarification on the difference between a commodity and a security, are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

## Contrast with Previous Administration
The shift under a [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump]] administration is seen as a "complete 180" from the policies of 2022 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. The previous administration's policies, such as the interpretive rule from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) seeking to make non-custodial crypto wallets liable for lost assets, are expected to be reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Policy Implications
> Such a rule would make wallet manufacturers responsible for funds lost due to phishing scams, lost seed phrases, or user irresponsibility, making it impossible to run a non-custodial wallet in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. This is seen as a bullet dodged by the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

## Broader Economic Impact
The prospect of a [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump]] presidency also brings discussions of "Trump bucks" and fiscal dominance, potentially leading to a high inflation era due to increased government spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Overall, the crypto industry is optimistic about the direction under a [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump]] administration, viewing it as a significant positive shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Ethereum, after a period of significant growth, finds itself at a crossroads, needing to re-evaluate its strategy and narrative to achieve its full potential. The goal is to see ETH sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with Bitcoin as the second major money to emerge from crypto, supported by a coherent and successful product stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. This requires a shift in focus within the Ethereum community, encompassing a new form of maximalism, nationalism, and a refined narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

## Reorienting Ethereum's Identity
The current discussion within the Ethereum community aims to define what Ethereum needs to do to "finish the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. While some view the problem through a "mimetic lens" focusing on social layer changes and memes, others approach it with a "product lens," prioritizing the roadmap and a product-led reorientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This internal work, often referred to as "layer zero" or "social layer" work, is crucial for setting the house straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

### The Problem: A Stagnant Product Stack
Ethereum's growth has stalled since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. The prevailing strategy prioritized the Ethereum Layer 1, then immediately pushed for Layer 2s, expecting developers, applications, and users to reside there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This "rollup-centric roadmap" led to a severing of the positive feedback loop that previously existed on the Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Each Layer 2 developed its own network effects, preventing them from reintegrating value back into the Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

## Maximalism: The Blue Money Gospel
The first call to action is for [[balancing_maximalism_and_flexibility_in_the_ethereum_community | Ether the asset maximalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. While the term "maximalism" often carries negative connotations of toxicity and close-mindedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, it can also represent an unrelenting focus and support for a particular asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

Ether maximalism means believing that "ETH is good" and that "ETH to $10 trillion is good for the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Without a strong Ether asset, there can be no DeFi or cyberpunk values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The Ethereum community has been perceived as weak in evangelizing the value of Ether, spending too much time on the network and other assets, and not enough on the asset itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

This contrasts with the [[cultural_differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | Bitcoin community]], which successfully propagated the "Orange Coin number go up" mantra, turning Bitcoin into a multi-trillion-dollar store of value through social layer evangelism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Ethereum, on the other hand, exhibits a "wealth aversion" or "hesitancy" towards emphasizing the asset's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

**The "Discounted Cash Flow Hell"**:
Ether is often valued based on its revenue production, similar to a cash-flowing equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This is seen as a mischaracterization, as Ether is a global, censorship-resistant, programmable store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. The "cash" it throws off is denominated in Ether itself, and the burn mechanism is a monetary feature reducing supply, not a traditional cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
:::

The prescription for Ether maximalism is to talk more about Ether the asset, play the "ground game," and evangelize its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This includes encouraging holding and staking ETH, and [[meme_culture_and_marketing_ethereum_as_digital_gold | meming ETH as digital gold with yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This approach is dogmatic for Ether the asset but pragmatic for Ethereum the network and its technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Nationalism: Towards United Chains of Ethereum
The second call to action is for "Ethereum nationalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Ethereum is envisioned as a "network state," a new substrate for human coordination and economic activity, but it's currently too federated and uncoordinated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### The Articles of Confederation Analogy
Ethereum's current state is compared to the U.S. Articles of Confederation era (post-Revolutionary War, pre-Constitution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. At that time, the 13 colonies operated as separate nations, hindering foreign trade and coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Similarly, today's Layer 2s, like Polygon or Starknet, often feel like foreign countries with different currencies and borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

Ethereum's Layer 2s currently form a "security alliance" similar to NATO, where member chains benefit from Ethereum's security but can easily leave and operate with separate currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. The "United Chains of Ethereum" that was promised has not yet materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

### The Path to a United Ethereum
Ethereum needs to move from its "Articles of Confederation era" to its "Constitution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. This means a protocol upgrade to more closely align the chains into a unified network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

[[importance_of_defining_core_values_for_ethereum | Ethereum nationalism]] means fusing these separate chains into one network state, where the "nation" represents shared values and the "state" is the protocol and bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. A focal point for this national energy can be [[ethereums_leadership_and_community_dynamics | Ether the asset]], through rituals like buying and holding ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

L2s are encouraged to become "nationalistic" by economically aligning with Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Holding a portion of their treasury in Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   Accepting transaction fees in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   Promoting Ether as a central point in wallets and dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

A stronger Layer 1 is foundational for this unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Rather than causing L2s to defect, a strong L1 attracts more chains, creating a positive-sum environment where L2s want to ally with the "winner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

### The Role of Based and Native Rollups
To achieve true economic alignment and interoperability, Layer 2s need to evolve beyond merely "posting DA" to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. The goal is to encourage a shift towards "based and native rollups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>:
*   **Based rollups** are more tightly integrated, potentially sharing sequencing or execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. They act more like "territories of an Ethereum republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   **Native rollups** share Ethereum's settlement, DA, sequencing, and execution, blurring the lines between Layer 1 and Layer 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. They function like "states" within a unified nation, using the same money (Ether) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

This transition requires making it economically appealing for L2s to adopt these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Current L2Beat stages, while valuable for property rights, don't account for this necessary economic alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Without this, Ethereum risks fragmentation, similar to Cosmos, which struggled to maintain a weak center and integrate its chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Narrative: Ether as a Commodity Money Backed by an Economy
The third call to action is to refine the narrative surrounding Ether. Instead of being viewed as a cash-flowing equity, Ether should be understood as a "commodity money backed by an economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

**The "America Index" Analogy**:
Investing in Ether is akin to buying an index of the entire internet economy, similar to how one might have invested in a basket of U.S. stocks, bonds, and land (all priced in USD) after World War II to bet on the rise of Pax Americana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. ETH, as the native currency, automatically captures the upside of the Ethereum property rights empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
:::

Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as digital gold without a sprawling on-chain economy, Ethereum boasts a vast and growing on-chain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This is the core value proposition that needs to be communicated to Wall Street and the wider world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## The Community's Role in Marketing and Growth
The Ethereum community itself is an integral part of the "Ethereum product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Like Bitcoiners, the community needs to act as a sales force, promoting the Ethereum Layer 1 as the economic hub of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

Past messaging, such as "get off the Layer 1" or "Layer 1 is not for users," must cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Instead, the message should be that Layer 1 is for *everyone*: builders, users, tokenized assets, and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Expanding the capacity of the Layer 1]] is crucial to keep fees low and accommodate more activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### Avoiding "Purity Testing"
The Ethereum community needs to stop "purity testing" or "gerrymandering support" around use cases perceived as distasteful or immoral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Examples include the ostracization of Lido for its staking centralization concerns or the resistance to memecoins, speculation, and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This moralistic approach has driven speculators and traders to other chains like Solana, costing Ethereum liquidity and volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

Speculators and traders are critical "bootloaders" for new applications, bringing the first capital and fostering breeding grounds for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Given Ethereum's core value of permissionlessness, policing use cases is contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. The Layer 1 must be open for "absolutely everything," including dgens and tokenized Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: Can Ethereum Still Win?
Achieving the vision of a multi-trillion-dollar Ether asset and a successful network where Ethereum's Layer 1 is the central economic hub for internet property rights is a challenging but achievable goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. While Bitcoin has steadily grown its "digital gold" brand, Ether has lost some of its "moneyiness" and is currently valued in a crowded smart contract platform market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

However, Ethereum possesses the most ambitious vision in crypto – to become an entire on-chain economy, not just a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. If it can pull off this vision, it will be unstoppable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. The market may currently be pricing Ether at a tremendous discount, presenting a significant opportunity for those who believe in its potential to counter-trade the prevailing narrative and realize its grand unified vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

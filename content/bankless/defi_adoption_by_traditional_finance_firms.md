A survey conducted by Paradigm's policy team investigated the engagement level of traditional finance (TradFi) institutions with internet money and finance, specifically [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The report, titled "TradFi Tomorrow, DeFi, and the Rise of Extensible Finance," polled 300 TradFi professionals globally, spanning various roles, institutions, and regions, including asset managers, retail and corporate banks, investment banks, payments companies, VCs, private equity firms, and financial market infrastructure providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## What is DeFi to TradFi?

[[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] is viewed by TradFi as a concept representing "permissionless peer-to-peer engagement and networks," a notion that currently has no direct analog in traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. The appeal of [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] to these institutions is its ecumenical and broad nature, rather than fascination with a single specific product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Motivations for Engagement

The primary motivations for TradFi's engagement with crypto and [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] are to reduce costs, shorten settlement times, and increase transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The survey revealed that improving efficiency and reducing manual labor are the top reasons TradFi explores new technologies generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. The current traditional financial system's "insanely inefficient and manual" processes, including settlement and handling of instruments, drive the interest in automation via blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Automated smart contracts reduce errors, compliance costs, and increase speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Engagement Levels and Activities

The survey found a "surprisingly high amount of interest" in crypto and [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **66% of TradFi firms** are actively engaged with [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   This engagement includes building and launching products, running pilot programs, investing in crypto firms or [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] protocols, and participating in consortiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   A little under a third of firms are "researching or exploring," conducting analyses and strategic planning without active product involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   The level of engagement indicates that institutions are not merely waiting for regulatory clarity but are "chomping at the bit" and "setting up their pieces" for future adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

## Areas of Interest

TradFi professionals showed significant interest across various [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] components:
*   **[[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | Tokenization of assets]]** (especially stablecoins and treasuries) was at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. This includes stocks, bonds, and derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Tokenized bonds are showing early S-curve growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **[[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | Stablecoins]]** are seen as the "global foot in the door" for traditional finance to become comfortable with crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes)** are also a key area of interest, nearly on par with tokenization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. While institutions are becoming comfortable with on-chain trading, they may initially prefer "Coinbase verified pools" or similar solutions that allow for restricted, KYC-only participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. However, the interoperability of [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] means liquidity can flow efficiently between different types of DEXes, benefiting the broader ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
*   **Lending and Borrowing** protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Prediction Markets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Interoperability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

## Private vs. Public Blockchains

The report highlights a "formal rejection of private blockchains" by TradFi, recognizing the superior value of public, permissionless blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.
*   The primary reason for this preference is the connectivity to liquidity and network effects on public blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.
*   "Closed loop" consortia between a few banks are seen as less valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
*   The rise of Layer 2 (L2) solutions is seen as a key factor enabling this shift, offering both scalability and customizability that appeals to financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. This could lead to centralized L2s launching on decentralized L1s, offering the control institutions desire while still benefiting from the L1's ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
*   TradFi's interest in public blockchains is driven by their size and existing economic activity (GDP growth), rather than their decentralization or credible neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.

## The [[Regulatory landscape for DeFi | Regulatory Landscape]]

[[The impact of financial institutions signaling readiness to adopt crypto | Financial institutions]] are aligning with crypto goals, but the primary bottleneck for wider adoption remains [[Regulatory landscape for DeFi | compliance and regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>.
*   While the SEC is making progress in allowing existing crypto participants to use [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] without fear of non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>, other regulators like the FDIC, OCC, and Fed need to explicitly permit regulated entities (banks, hedge funds, credit card companies) to access [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.
*   Current legislative action mostly focuses on centralized finance (CeFi), as there's no existing model for [[Regulatory landscape for DeFi | DeFi regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.
*   A key principle for [[Regulatory landscape for DeFi | DeFi regulation]] is "do no harm," while simultaneously enabling firms to access and understand the space through experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Despite regulatory hurdles, the long-term outlook for [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]]'s integration into traditional finance is optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.
*   TradFi generally believes that [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] will have little impact on their core business in the next 1-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   However, sentiment shifts significantly when looking 6-10 years out, with an increasing number of firms viewing [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] as "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.
*   Notably, 28% of respondents believe [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] will be "critically important" to their business within 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. This signifies that powerful financial firms see [[Benefits of DeFi for institutions | immense value]] in [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] and are likely to adopt it soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   The focus for builders should be on developing protocols that can handle an influx of diverse real-world assets, such as decentralized lending and borrowing platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Key Takeaways
> *   The interest from TradFi in [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] goes beyond mere tokenization; they are open to the full range of what [[Challenges and developments in decentralized finance | DeFi]] offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
> *   The "tokenize the world" narrative is becoming a reality, fueled by maturing infrastructure (like cheaper transactions on scaling blockchains) and a more favorable [[Regulatory landscape for DeFi | regulatory environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
> *   TradFi is not waiting for a full regulatory green light; they are strategically positioning themselves for when the "frontier opens up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

The future of the US economy is being shaped by various factors, including [[trumps_economic_policies_and_their_impact | Donald Trump's economic policies]] and the ongoing discussion around global military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Jim Bianco of Bianco Research provides insights into how these elements interact and their potential economic impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>.

## US Debt and Defense Spending

A significant portion of the United States' $36 trillion national debt has accumulated over the last 80 years due to the country's extensive spending on global defense in the post-World War II era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. The US military, particularly its navy, has maintained open shipping lanes, fought communism, and combated terrorism, incurring trillions of dollars in costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

### "Free Ride" for Allies
Canada, Mexico, and European nations have military budgets that are a fraction of the US's as a percentage of their GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. This has led to the argument that these countries have benefited from a "free ride" under the US security umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. The current administration argues that these allies should now contribute more to their own security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

For example, the US often bears the responsibility for patrolling and securing newly opened shipping lanes in the Arctic, which are used by Chinese and Russian navies, despite these lanes being in Canadian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. Similarly, [[trumps_economic_policies_and_their_impact | Trump]] has pushed for Mexico to deploy troops on its border to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl, asserting that this responsibility should not solely fall to the US military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.

The US currently spends approximately $900 billion annually on defense, serving as a security umbrella for the entire free world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.

## Europe's Increased Defense Commitments
European nations are beginning to acknowledge the need to increase their own defense spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. They plan to dramatically raise their defense budgets and create a federated European Army capable of greater self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. Europe intends to issue $3 trillion in European bonds over the next decade to enhance military preparedness and readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. This shift could potentially allow the US to reduce its military presence in Europe and, consequently, its defense budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

## Economic Interests and Security Agreements
Economic interests are increasingly tied to security agreements. For instance, discussions around Ukraine's rare earth mineral deposits highlight this connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>. The US seeks to secure access to these critical minerals like lithium and cobalt to reduce reliance on countries like Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. This pursuit of mineral rights creates a "vested interest" for the US to offer security assistance and potentially negotiate peace agreements that protect these economic endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

## Impact on US Economy and Debt
The argument is that if these efforts to rebalance global security burdens are executed properly, they could lead to a reduction in the US deficit, an improvement in the [[impact_of_global_reserve_currency_status_of_us_dollar_on_trade_deficits | trade deficit]], and subsequently, a decrease in the amount of bonds the US needs to issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. This, in turn, could help lower interest rates over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.

The goal is to shift away from [[us_economys_dependency_on_government_spending | government-injected GDP growth]] towards more organic, high-quality economic activity driven by innovation and genuine business expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>. This reorientation of the economy, including [[implications_of_changing_global_trade_relationships | changing global trade relationships]] and defense burden-sharing, could lead to a more stable and productive economic future for the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

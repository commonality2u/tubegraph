The landscape of [[role_of_regulation_in_the_crypto_industry | regulation]] within the crypto industry, particularly concerning the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), appears to be shifting. Previously viewed with skepticism by some in the crypto community, the SEC's stance is showing signs of becoming more supportive of blockchain technology and digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

## Shifting Stance from the SEC

Historically, the SEC, particularly under its previous leadership, was perceived as antagonistic towards crypto, with public statements often highlighting risks and scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. However, recent developments indicate a potential pivot towards a more welcoming approach for [[regulatory_developments_in_the_united_states_impacting_the_crypto_industry | regulatory changes and their implications for the crypto industry]].

### New Leadership and Priorities
The new SEC Chairman, Paul Atkins, has outlined a key priority for his chairmanship: to develop a rational [[regulatory_developments_in_the_united_states_impacting_the_crypto_industry | regulatory framework]] for crypto asset markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:07">[01:54:07]</a>. This framework aims to establish clear rules for the issuance, [[sec_developments_and_crypto_custody_regulations | custody]], and trading of crypto assets, while still discouraging illicit activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>. He emphasizes that clear rules are essential for investor protection against fraud and for identifying non-compliant scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:27">[01:54:27]</a>. This is seen by some as a move towards providing the much-needed clarity that the crypto industry has long sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.

### Official Statements
The SEC's official Twitter account has also begun to post content indicating a more positive outlook on blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:25">[01:55:25]</a>. One such statement compared the movement of securities from off-chain to on-chain systems to the transition of audio recordings from analog to digital formats, suggesting that blockchain is the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:29">[01:55:29]</a>. The post further elaborated that the migration to on-chain securities has the potential to remodel aspects of the securities market by enabling new methods of issuing, trading, owning, and using securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:50">[01:55:50]</a>. This level of comfort expressed by the SEC is considered highly significant for founders in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>.

### Role of Hester Peirce
Commissioner [[role_of_hester_peirce_and_the_sec_crypto_task_force | Hester Peirce]], who has been a vocal proponent of crypto for years, remains at the SEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:20">[01:56:20]</a>. Her long-standing "sandbox idea" proposes creating an environment where firms can issue, trade, and settle tokenized stocks directly on-chain, cutting through traditional regulatory red tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:31">[01:56:31]</a>. This indicates an SEC program that would actively encourage, rather than merely neutralize, tokenized securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:51">[01:56:51]</a>.

The emerging perspective is that the SEC is now viewing blockchain technology as an extension of its mandate to promote fair and orderly capital formation, rather than an antagonistic force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:17">[01:57:17]</a>.

## Distinction: Enforcement vs. Standards
A crucial distinction is drawn between the SEC's role in enforcement and the establishment of standards within the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>. While the SEC focuses on enforcement, entities like L2Beat are seen as setting industry standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:49">[01:46:49]</a>. L2Beat, for instance, creates objective and transparent criteria for blockchain rollups to achieve various "property rights guarantees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. This market-based, bottom-up approach to standards setting, followed by community norms, is considered an underrated asset for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

## Implications for the Future of Crypto
### Tokenized Securities
The discussion highlights a desire for "real internet capital markets" where developers can issue equity coins that offer genuine claims on cash flows, as opposed to the current "meme coin issued apps" trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>. Robert Lesner's Superstate is working on its "Open Bell" platform, which aims to issue and put tokenized securities on-chain, making stocks fully transferable, programmable, and integrated into DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>. This directly contrasts with the current "internet capital markets meta," which involves memecoins launched alongside consumer applications, often generating revenue from trading fees rather than core utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:49">[01:42:49]</a>.

### ETH Staking ETFs
With BlackRock engaging with the SEC, there's speculation that an ETH staking ETF is likely to be approved within the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:41">[01:57:41]</a>. While the impact of ETH ETFs on price has been debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:11">[01:58:11]</a>, the potential conversion of all ETH ETFs to staking ETFs is seen as an inevitable future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:50">[01:57:50]</a>. This is part of the broader [[regulatory_developments_affecting_crypto_etfs | regulatory developments affecting crypto ETFs]].

### AML/KYC and Privacy
The current Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations are identified as creating "privacy nightmares" and "honeypots" for hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. These regulations require financial institutions to collect extensive personal data, including government IDs and transaction details, which are then stored in databases susceptible to breaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:11">[01:34:11]</a>. The alternative proposed is using zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) for identity verification, which allows for confirmation of details (like age or citizenship) without revealing sensitive personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>. This would prevent the creation of centralized data honeypots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>.

There is concern that without proper legislation and strong cryptography, the industry might face a "worst of all worlds" scenario: bad actors using on-chain privacy while good actors are still subject to AML/KYC, leading to data leaks and untraceable hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Overall Sentiment
The overall sentiment is one of bullishness regarding the future of crypto in the U.S., with the perceived shift in the SEC's approach being a significant contributing factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. The confluence of macro news, Bitcoin's performance, and the changing [[regulation_changes_in_the_crypto_industry | regulatory environment]] creates a strong positive outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.

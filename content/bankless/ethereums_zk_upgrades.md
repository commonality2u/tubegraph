Ethereum is on the cusp of significant upgrades related to Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography, promising to accelerate the Layer 1 (L1) throughput by potentially 100x and enable reduced block times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This development, highlighted by figures like Justin Drake and Uma, centers around the concept of "real-time proving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Understanding ZK Proofs and Their Impact

Traditionally, all blockchain nodes must re-execute every block to verify its validity, which is a major bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This means the same computation is performed repeatedly across every node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

With ZK proofs, only one computer needs to perform the complex computation (like solving a Sudoku puzzle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. The other nodes then only need to quickly verify the correctness of that proof, rather than re-doing the entire computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. This drastically increases efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

Ethereum's L1 currently has 12-second blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. If ZK proofs can be generated in less than 12 seconds, it unlocks significant scaling benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Currently, 99% of all Ethereum L1 blocks are approved in under 13 seconds, indicating how close the ecosystem is to this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Key Benefits and Implications

The progress in ZK proving technology, which is advancing faster than anticipated on an exponential curve, enables several critical advancements for [[Ethereums strategic roadmap | Ethereum's strategic roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>:

1.  **Enhanced Cross-Chain Composability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>: Real-time proving allows the state of one Layer 2 (L2) to be referenced by another L2, fostering stronger interoperability within the [[Ethereums scalability and innovation | Ethereum L2 ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
2.  **Enshrined ZK Rollup on L1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>: The Ethereum L1 will be able to decouple its execution layer from the consensus layer, effectively transforming into an enshrined ZK rollup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This could lead to a 100x increase in L1 throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. While block times will remain at 12 seconds initially, block sizes could be a thousand times larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. As ZK proving times continue to decrease, further reductions in block times are also possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
3.  **Credible Path to 10,000 TPS** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>: This technology provides a clear roadmap for [[Ethereums scalability and innovation | scaling Ethereum L1 to 10,000 transactions per second]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. This scalability can be achieved incrementally, potentially with a 3x increase each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
4.  **Gravity Well for Rollups** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>: The L1's transformation into a native rollup acts as a "gravity well" for other rollups that post data availability on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This incentivizes them to become "base native rollups," leading to greater interoperability and a more unified "United Chains of Ethereum" ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## Timeline and Challenges

Optimistic estimates, such as those from Justin Drake, suggest this could happen in as little as three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Others, like Donrad, project six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Averaging these, a four-and-a-half-year timeline for full 10,000 TPS is a reasonable expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

However, challenges remain:
*   Formal verification of the technology is still needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   The computational cost and energy requirements for ZK proving need to decrease further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Currently, it requires the equivalent energy of 10 Teslas plugged in simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. The goal is to reduce this to one Tesla's equivalent, making at-home proving more feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   Bugs in the implementation must be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

## Decentralizing the Proving Network

Companies like Succinct, which contribute to the ZK prover technology, are launching decentralized prover networks and associated tokens (e.g., the Pro token) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This decentralizes the system, ensuring a robust network of provers to generate Sudoku puzzles (proofs) for the Ethereum L1 and L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. The Ethereum Foundation has also been investing in building marketable ZK prover hardware to facilitate broader participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

This long-term [[Ethereums roadmap and future potential | Ethereum roadmap and future potential]] has been a consistent focus, aiming for an "endgame" where the network achieves unprecedented scale and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

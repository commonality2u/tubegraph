True success, exemplified by figures like Elon Musk, is not an overnight achievement but rather a product of long-term dedication and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is viewed as the result of 50 years of pain, suffering, work, and compounding efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Assembling a High-Performing Team

A significant, yet often underappreciated, factor in sustained effectiveness is the ability to assemble a highly talented collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Over 20 to 30 years, an individual can gather a group of approximately 20 exceptionally talented people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Finding Talent

Identifying such individuals is rare; one might only encounter a couple of these highly capable people annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### The Importance of [[the_role_of_time_and_testing_in_discovering_talent|Testing]]

It typically takes a decade of [[the_role_of_time_and_testing_in_discovering_talent|testing]] an individual to truly understand their potential and confirm their reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Examples of such key individuals include Mark Josa at SpaceX and Steve Davis at Boring Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Most companies led by highly successful individuals feature about five such "out of this world" talented people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Team Synergy

These core team members often develop a "mind meld," enabling them to work together seamlessly without needing explicit communication to understand what needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The Long Game

This process of building an effective, self-sustaining "organism" cannot be rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It typically requires around 20 years to reach a state of maximal evolution and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

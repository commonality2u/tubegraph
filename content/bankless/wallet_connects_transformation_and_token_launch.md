Wallet Connect, a sponsor of Bankless, has initiated a significant transformation in its ecosystem, moving towards a more decentralized future with the introduction of its own token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Current Adoption and Purpose
Wallet Connect has been widely adopted, facilitating over 255 million connections from 40 million unique users globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Its primary function allows users to connect their wallets to various decentralized applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Entering its "Final Form"
To further decentralize and protocolize its operations, Wallet Connect is evolving into what it describes as its "final form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. A key step in this transformation is the introduction of the Wallet Connect token, which is considered the "last capstone building block" of its ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The launch of this token aims to usher Wallet Connect closer to a future that is fully decentralized, permissionless, and community-owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Aspirations and Future Vision
Wallet Connect aspires to a trajectory similar to that of established financial messaging networks like Visa or Swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This comparison highlights its ambition to become a fundamental, decentralized infrastructure layer for wallet connections in the crypto space.

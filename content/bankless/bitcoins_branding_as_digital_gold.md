Bitcoin's trajectory has seen continuous growth, distinguishing its market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A key aspect of this sustained growth is its branding as [[gold_and_bitcoin_as_financial_strategies | digital gold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Sustained Growth and Government Recognition

Bitcoin's "arc" has continued without stopping, fostering its identity as [[gold_and_bitcoin_as_financial_strategies | digital gold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This branding has been so effective that it is now regarded as a "special snowflake" by the United States, the world's largest government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This recognition extends to the concept of a [[strategic_bitcoin_reserve_concept | strategic Bitcoin reserve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, which is described as something Ethereum should aspire to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Contrast with Ethereum

In contrast to Bitcoin's established position, Ether (Ethereum's native currency) has "lost its moneyiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This has led to Ethereum's valuation falling into an "inferior bucket" as a smart contract layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This market is described as "very crowded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, with many centralized, faster-moving competitors willing to "cut corners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The current environment is not considered suitable for Ethereum to win in, and it needs to "get out of that environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

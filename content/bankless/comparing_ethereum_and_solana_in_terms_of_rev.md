## What is REV?

In the context of the current crypto discussion, Real Economic Value (REV) refers to all the network fees and Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) tips that users pay for a given network [01:23:17].

REV can be viewed in two primary ways:
*   **Value Capture Metric** In a proof-of-stake network like Ethereum or Solana, REV acts as a value capture metric. Token holders are entitled to receive this REV in some form, whether through token burns or dividends paid to stakers [05:12:00]. This is analogous to a top-line revenue metric for a traditional company [05:40:00].
*   **Demand Indicator** REV serves as a helpful demand indicator, showing what users are explicitly willing to pay to use a network [06:00:00]. It specifically excludes app-level fees (e.g., fees paid to Uniswap) and focuses solely on actual network-level fees and MEV tips [06:10:00].

It's important to distinguish this definition of REV from "Realized Extractable Value," an older term used by Flashbots, which refers to the actual captured subset of MEV [03:45:00]. The current REV metric is unrelated to that specific definition [04:03:00].

## Historical Valuation at All-Time Highs

A recent tweet by John Sharpo initiated the current discussion on REV [01:03:00]. By analyzing historical data, it was observed that both Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) traded at nearly the exact same multiple to their annualized REV when they reached their all-time high prices (ETH in late 2021, SOL in January this year) [01:43:00]. Both networks were also generating their highest REV at those specific points [02:02:00].

This observation prompts two interpretations:
*   **Rational Market** The market traded rationally, with prices increasing because the networks were generating significant revenue [02:21:00].
*   **Correlation** On-chain activity is typically at its peak during all-time high prices, leading to higher fees as people are willing to spend more [02:28:00].

The reality likely involves a degree of both factors [02:44:00]. The market is increasingly looking for signs that users are willing to pay for network usage [02:48:00]. While not valuing tokens strictly based on cash flows like traditional equities, REV is becoming one of several factors considered for larger tokens [03:03:00].

## REV, Blockspace, and Native Assets

REV strongly correlates with the utility value of a blockchain's blockspace, particularly for smart contracting platforms [07:38:00]. For example, [[ethereum_pivot_versus_reprioritization | Ethereum]]'s value is derived from its app ecosystem (e.g., MakerDAO, Uniswap), and [[solana_governance_and_monetary_policy_debate | Solana]]'s value comes from its applications (e.g., Pump Fun, Drift) [07:22:00].

However, REV is less relevant for understanding the value of a native asset like Bitcoin, which has zero REV but is the most highly valued crypto asset [07:52:00]. This suggests that for smart contracting platforms, the concept of REV is more pertinent to the total valuation of a chain due to the utility value of its blockspace [08:02:00].

Some argue that emphasizing REV "dog whistles" the utility value of blockspace, potentially favoring the [[ethereum_pivot_versus_reprioritization | Ethereum]] crowd and implying that other ecosystems (like [[solana_governance_and_monetary_policy_debate | Solana]]) are performing better in terms of this specific valuation metric [08:26:00].

## The Nascent State of Crypto Valuation

The crypto industry is still nascent, and there's no universally agreed-upon method for valuing assets [09:24:00]. REV is an earnest attempt to quantify value [10:12:00]. Cash flows, as measured by REV, can be considered the "minimum intrinsic value" of these assets [11:15:00]. Unlike assets whose value is purely speculative, an asset generating cash flow can be held and directly generate returns [11:29:00].

If utility and intrinsic value were the sole drivers, some initial coin offerings (ICOs) would be significantly overvalued. For example, at its peak, Aptos traded at a 1000x multiple to its annualized REV, Tron at 48x, and Avalanche at 136x, compared to ETH and SOL at ~26x [12:50:00]. This suggests that significant future growth is being priced in [13:24:00].

## Limitations and Future Outlook for REV

REV provides an objective measure of how much people are currently paying for blockspace, setting a "floor" for the equity-like valuation of projects [14:08:00]. However, it's an incomplete picture and doesn't account for other factors, such as Bitcoin's unique "special snowflake" properties [14:27:00]. Solely relying on REV would lead to a bearish outlook for crypto as a whole, which isn't the prevailing sentiment [14:55:00].

### App-Level Fees and Abstraction
In the future, REV could potentially approach zero if apps become highly efficient at recapturing all fees, even if those apps are widely used [15:27:00]. If applications on [[ethereum_pivot_versus_reprioritization | Ethereum]] were to capture all their fees, leaving zero for the blockchain itself, it would be positive for [[ethereum_pivot_versus_reprioritization | Ethereum]] in the short term due to a stronger market position, though its long-term impact on the ETH token price based on REV is unclear [16:09:00].

The all-time highs for REV on [[ethereum_pivot_versus_reprioritization | Ethereum]] correlated with ETH being the currency for NFTs, while for [[solana_governance_and_monetary_policy_debate | Solana]], it correlated with SOL being the currency for memecoins [17:56:00]. This highlights the "unit of account" nature of the native asset for primary on-chain activity [18:17:00]. A debate exists whether future transactions will be increasingly abstracted away to stablecoins like USDC rather than native assets [19:24:00]. While users like Andy 8052 prefer native currency (SOL) for trading due to best execution, there is a world where apps might use USDC as a base pair [20:01:00].

The "medium of exchange" component of a token contributes to buy pressure. For instance, holding [[solana_governance_and_monetary_policy_debate | Solana]] allows for one-click access to new tokens, and SOL locked in LP pools contributes to reservation demand [21:08:00]. The question remains how much this "moneyiness" property will erode if USDC becomes the dominant medium of exchange, leading to reduced demand for the native token [21:36:00].

### Real World Assets and the Native Currency
The impact of [[virtuals_launch_on_solana | real world assets]] (RWAs) coming on-chain on the local economies of native assets is uncertain [21:50:00]. Historically, crypto-native on-chain frenzies (e.g., NFT summer, DeFi summer, [[comparing_pudgy_penguins_to_dogecoin_and_solana | Solana]] memecoin craze) significantly boost the native Layer 1 asset as the currency [22:04:00]. However, the influx of $150 billion in stablecoins onto [[ethereum_pivot_versus_reprioritization | Ethereum]] has shown a relatively lackluster response from Ether as an asset [22:30:00]. The effect of a trillion dollars in tokenized RWAs on the local currency is unknown [22:47:00].

### Tribal Lines and Different Economic Models
The [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | REV debate]] is often split along tribal lines, with [[ethereum_pivot_versus_reprioritization | Ethereum]] proponents tending to diminish its importance and [[solana_governance_and_monetary_policy_debate | Solana]] supporters emphasizing it [28:40:00]. This is similar to how [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] and [[ethereum_pivot_versus_reprioritization | Ethereum]] maxis eventually realized they represented different economic models [30:20:00].

[[solana_governance_and_monetary_policy_debate | Solana]] is more likely to be dominantly valued by REV because it optimizes for state transitions and fast trading [30:41:00]. In contrast, [[ethereum_pivot_versus_reprioritization | Ethereum]] prioritizes "holding state" and long-term verifiability [31:03:00]. While more REV is generally better, its impact differs for each ecosystem [31:48:00].

There's an argument that newer Layer 1 blockchains will become even more REV-focused, prioritizing speed and revenue generation [33:40:00]. This contrasts with the [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] direction, which emphasizes "supply sinks" and monetary properties over velocity [34:10:00].

### Congestion vs. Priority Fees
Historically, [[ethereum_pivot_versus_reprioritization | Ethereum]]'s high REV numbers were predominantly from base fees due to network congestion [53:00:00]. [[solana_governance_and_monetary_policy_debate | Solana]], conversely, derives nearly all its REV from contentious state, MEV, and priority fees [53:28:00]. While expanding block space could potentially decrease base fees and thus REV, the more sustainable form of REV going forward is likely to come from access to contentious state, priority fees, and MEV, which [[solana_governance_and_monetary_policy_debate | Solana]] currently excels at [54:06:00].

However, even these margins might compress as apps find ways to internalize value (e.g., app sequencing) and infrastructure improves, reducing lock-in and shifting bargaining power towards applications [55:12:00]. High congestion fees are unlikely to be a sustainable source of demand for any network in the long term, unless there's an unfathomable increase in demand (e.g., millions of transactions per second from AI agents) [56:12:00]. Ultimately, this leads to a "bullish for apps, bearish for infrastructure" perspective, where value gravitates to execution environments that optimize for fast and cheap transactions [57:10:00].

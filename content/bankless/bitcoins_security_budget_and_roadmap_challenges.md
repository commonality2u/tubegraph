Bitcoin, as a decentralized digital currency, faces unique challenges related to its security budget and future roadmap, distinct from those encountered by platforms like Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.

## The Security Budget Question

The fundamental challenge for Bitcoin's security budget arises from its decreasing block subsidy, which is gradually moving towards zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. Eventually, the security of the network will depend entirely on transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>. To ensure network security, there needs to be sufficient chain usage to drive value back to the chain through fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.

The goal for Bitcoin is to generate millions to billions of dollars in annual fee revenue to make a 51% attack non-trivial and maintain a sufficient level of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>. While there's a non-zero probability of future issues, it's generally assumed that the market will work itself out, possibly through increased fees or a stable agreement among miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Roadmap and Layer 2s

Bitcoin also has a [[Bitcoin Layer 2 developments and potential challenges | rollup-centric roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Historically, both Ethereum and Bitcoin have had similar roadmaps, focusing on not scaling the Layer 1 (L1) but rather exporting functionality to other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>. For Bitcoin, this includes the Lightning Network and a recent resurgence of Bitcoin Layer 2s (L2s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.

A key concern is that while these L2s can extract value, they often do not post significant fees back to the mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. This raises questions about value accrual, user trust, and the overall economic model, especially as the L1 subsidy diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>.

> "Bitcoin will increase the block size eventually... I think that on a technical level a lot of this ends up looking the same but you just don't end up with the same problems because you're trying to solve for a completely different thing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>

### Comparison with Ethereum's Challenges
Unlike Ethereum, which aims for a multi-trillion dollar market capitalization driven by a broad range of applications and significant revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>, Bitcoin's objective is simpler: to ensure enough fees are generated to prevent network attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>. The value of BTC is largely decoupled from these fee generation concerns, as its primary function is as a non-sovereign store of value or "digital gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.

> "The economics of Bitcoin from a holder perspective are like set like you know exactly what you're going to get. You're going to get inflated every year. Like you're not going to get any value capture out of the network." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:44">[00:52:44]</a>

### Bitcoin's "Special Snowflake" Status
Bitcoin enjoys a unique position due to the fundamental user demand for BTC as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. This inherent desire to hold and use BTC means its L2s are definitionally more Bitcoin-centric and aligned, as people primarily want to use the BTC asset itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. This simplifies the challenge for Bitcoin compared to other chains, as it doesn't need to solve for significant value capture for its native token to the same extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

Despite this, there's still a risk if technical solutions for L2s are so poor that users cannot get reasonable access to BTC, which could become a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

### Market Perception and Long-Term Outlook
The market's perception has largely "extinguished" the belief that ETH could credibly compete with Bitcoin as a non-sovereign reserve asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. Bitcoin is widely seen as the "special snowflake," with a clear narrative as "digital gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. This perception is reinforced by actions like the U.S. government considering a [[The concept of strategic Bitcoin reserves | Bitcoin strategic reserve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

While there are long-term concerns about Bitcoin's security budget, they are not immediate short-term problems that will lead to other chains "winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>. The prevailing sentiment is that these issues will resolve themselves as the ecosystem matures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.

# Bitcoin's [[Crypto market trends and challenges | Market Trends]] and Outlook

Bitcoin and [[Challenges and infrastructure needs for stablecoin adoption | stablecoins]] represent the "barbell" ends of the crypto market, being globally important monetary assets and effective payment rails, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:53">[01:23:53]</a>. The "middle" of this barbell, representing on-chain richness, crypto culture, and consumer applications (like coining content or NFTs for identity), is currently thinner but is expected to grow proportionally to the strength of Bitcoin and stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:08">[01:25:08]</a>. If Bitcoin's value grows, this could lead to increased liquidity and volume across the ecosystem, supporting the growth of other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:16">[01:25:16]</a>.

The global financial system appears to be on the precipice of significant change, with projections indicating a shift in global monetary dynamics and the potential emergence of a new monetary order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This shift is influenced by cycles in global liquidity and the breakdown of existing international structures.

## Global Liquidity Cycles

According to a chart put forth by Ralph Paul, global M2, a projection of [[potential_changes_in_global_liquidity_and_their_implications | global liquidity]], is currently at a bottoming zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The last few years have seen a cycle of decreasing [[potential_changes_in_global_liquidity_and_their_implications | global monetary liquidity]] across all fiat systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, a new four-year liquidity cycle is beginning, with M2 projected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Economic Pain and Monetary Policy

In the event of a recession, particularly one leading to American capital flight, there is an expectation that [[money_printing_and_economic_policy | money printers]] will activate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This response, aimed at easing economic pain, is generally considered bullish for cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If economic pain intensifies, the value of global fiat currencies is expected to decrease as central banks resort to [[money_printing_and_economic_policy | printing money]] to mitigate suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This aligns with the Bitcoiner thesis regarding [[money_printing_and_economic_policy | monetary policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Perspective

Ray Dalio, in an article titled "It's too late, the changes are coming," highlights that the world is on the brink of a new monetary order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. He posits that both domestic political and international world orders are deteriorating due to identifiable and measurable unsustainable fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Key issues contributing to this breakdown include:
*   **Trade imbalances** The need for China to become less dependent on United States debt and for the United States to reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Economic pain management** The anticipated pain from these economic realignments will likely be addressed through extensive [[money_printing_and_economic_policy | money printing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Cultivating Ethereum's Store of Value Narrative

For [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | Ethereum]] (ETH) to solidify its position as a store of value, proponents suggest actively promoting specific behaviors and narratives within the community:
*   Encourage holding ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Advocate for others to hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.
*   Criticize Layer 2 solutions (L2s), treasuries, whales, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that do not hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   Celebrate and reward those who hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   Promote staking, restaking, and auto-staking ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   Meme ETH as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Utilize various media—writing, tweeting, podcasting, and "ship posting"—to spread this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Elect leaders who also promote these ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Propagandize the idea that "1 ETH equals 1 ETH" until it becomes common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Comparison to Bitcoin and Gold

The concept of a store of value, whether it's gold or [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market analysis | Bitcoin]], is described as "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Gold's value is based on "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market analysis | Bitcoin]] is characterized by "pure irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

It is suggested that [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | Ethereum]], despite its perceived "smart" and "ivory tower" nature, has not fully grasped the importance of the "meme layer narrative" required to establish a strong store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Community Strategy for Ethereum's Asset Narrative

A strategy for strengthening ETH's position involves a more assertive approach within the [[differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | Ethereum community]]:
*   While "shaming" non-ETH holders might seem off-putting, it is presented as a means to "win" in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   Not all members of the [[differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | Ethereum community]] may adopt such an aggressive stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   The goal is to cultivate a contingent of "ETH bulls" who are highly enthusiastic about ETH, similar to [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market analysis | Bitcoin]]'s "laser eyes" proponents, but without necessarily adopting "Bitcoin toxicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum]] is noted for having an economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   The [[cultivating_a_strong_ethereum_community_narrative | Ethereum community]] needs to reorient its discourse to focus more on the ETH asset itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

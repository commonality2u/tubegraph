From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Every Layer 1 (L1) blockchain has a native token, often referred to as an L1 token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Understanding how to value these tokens is crucial for investors seeking to identify what drives returns and evaluate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This question is particularly significant given that L1 tokens constitute the vast majority—around 95%—of the total crypto market capitalization, which is north of $3 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This includes major players like [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]], [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]], and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Historical Valuation Methodologies

Over time, various traditional economic and financial models have been adapted to attempt to value L1 tokens, with varying degrees of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

### MV = PQ (Quantity Theory of Money)

This monetary theory suggests that the money supply (M) multiplied by its velocity (V) must equal price (P) times output (Q), or nominal GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. It centers the valuation of money on its velocity and the rate of spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Popularized around 2016-2017 for [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]], this model has largely fallen out of favor as a primary way to value L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

### Stock-to-Flow

Popularized by [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_analysis | Bitcoin]] proponents, this model is based on the assumption that scarcity, measured by the ratio of existing supply to annual issuance, directly drives value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. It draws parallels to gold, where demand is not easily met with increasing supply, making it price-sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. However, critics argue that stock-to-flow is heavily supply-side focused and implicitly assumes infinite persistent demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This model has not held up well as a general valuation metric for L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### Consensus: Bitcoin as a "Special Snowflake"

Currently, there's a consensus among some analysts that [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] is a "special snowflake" that can be valued similarly to gold, as a non-sovereign store of value asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. This approach considers Bitcoin's potential to capture a percentage of the gold market's total addressable market (TAM), which is around $18 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Bitcoin]] bulls even argue that the digital version should eventually surpass the analog version in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

## Revenue (REV) and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

For all other L1 assets, the current consensus valuation approach often defaults to a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on a metric called "REV" (Revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] REV (Revenue)
> REV measures the total amount of fees users pay to L1 validators, representing the value validators capture from transaction activity on the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

Analysts interpret REV as akin to company cash flows and use it to feed DCF models, arguing that L1 tokens can be valued like companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. A DCF model determines the present value of an asset as the sum of all future cash flows, discounted by a rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This approach was formalized for stocks in 1938 and became consensus for valuing equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

### Critique of REV and DCF for L1 Tokens

A key critique of applying DCF to L1 tokens is that these tokens are *not* company shares and do not accrue value like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
1.  **Circular Reference:** L1 validators do not collect revenue in a non-native currency like USDC; they earn more of the native token (e.g., ETH, SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. This creates a circular reference, making it difficult to value the asset in dollar terms without a non-circular fundamental driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:02]</a>.
2.  **Network Effect vs. Company Value:** A mental test reveals the difference: If one wallet owned 100% of Apple shares, the company's value wouldn't change. However, if one wallet owned 100% of [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]] (ETH) or Solana (SOL), the network's value would effectively be zero because there would be no other users paying fees or transacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>. This highlights that L1 tokens derive value from network effects, not just internal cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.
3.  **Fees Trend to Zero:** While REV provides a snapshot of current demand to use a blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>, it's argued that transaction fees (and thus REV) will tend towards zero over time as [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_solutions | blockchain networks scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:56:00">[30:56:00]</a>. As supply of blockspace expands dramatically (e.g., [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum's Layer 1]] blockspace could 100x with ZK dream, plus [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_solutions | Layer 2 solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:24:00">[34:24:00]</a>), the cost of transactions deflates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:00">[29:38:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Bearish Outlook?
> Analysts who prioritize DCF/REV for L1 tokens might be considered "bearish" because they are missing the significantly larger total addressable market (TAM) implied by L1s being digital non-sovereign money, rather than just companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>.

## L1 Tokens as Money: A New Framework

The core argument is that L1 tokens are fundamentally *money*, not company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>.

> [!DEFINITION] Money
> Money is defined as any asset primarily used to make payments and as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>. This definition applies to fiat currencies (used for payments and storing wealth in bonds/deposits) and L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>.

L1 tokens are used for payments for on-chain services and goods (transactions are paid in the native token) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. They are also used as a store of value through staking and as deposit assets in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>. While the term "money" might carry baggage of nation-state fiat, L1s are seen as splitting the difference between commodity money (like gold/copper) and fiat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. They have an economy and a "GDP," where users pay "taxes" (fees) in the native unit of account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>.

The emphasis for L1 token valuation should be on their **store of value (SOV) use case**, rather than payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>. The supply of L1 tokens (e.g., [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | ETH]] inflating by a small percentage annually) is fundamentally constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>, unlike the rapidly expanding supply of blockspace for payments. Demand growth for SOV is not met with more supply, which drives price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a>.

## Realized Store of Value (RSOV)

A new metric, Realized Store of Value (RSOV), is proposed to measure the monetary value accruing to L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:04:00">[46:04:00]</a>.

> [!DEFINITION] Realized Store of Value (RSOV)
> RSOV tracks the two primary drivers of store of value demand for L1 tokens, measuring "ground truth" usage and actual demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:30:00">[46:30:00]</a>:
> 1.  The realized value of L1 tokens staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:39:00">[46:39:00]</a>.
> 2.  The realized value of L1 tokens in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:42:00">[46:42:00]</a>.
>
> Inspired by [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_analysis | Bitcoin's]] "realized cap" metric, RSOV acts as a net daily inflows metric, using the USD value of tokens when they were last transacted into these specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:04:00]</a>. It reflects the aggregate cost basis of value staked and value in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:39:00">[51:39:00]</a>.

RSOV fundamentally measures net inflows of dollars into the network that *remain* in the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[35:51:00]</a>. This includes behaviors like buying ETH and staking it, or depositing ETH into DeFi protocols (e.g., MakerDAO, Uniswap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>. These actions represent a "hodling" behavior, reducing velocity and increasing the "cost basis" of the token in these supply sinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:03:00">[53:03:00]</a>.

### RSOV and REV Interplay

REV is implicitly incorporated into RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. When transaction fees (REV) are high, it means that L1 assets are being transferred from "spenders" to "savers" (stakers). As validators or stakers compound their earnings by holding the native token, the realized value of staked tokens increases, thus growing RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. For example, during NFT mania on [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]] or memecoin mania on Solana, high gas fees (REV) meant a hastened transfer of ETH/SOL to stakers, showing up in RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>.

### Driving RSOV Growth

Factors that increase RSOV for an L1 network:
*   **Inflows into Staking:** Higher staking yields can attract more capital, akin to the "dollar milkshake theory" where higher yields lead to a stronger dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.
*   **Changed Market Perception:** If the market perceives an asset as lower risk, it might accept lower yields, leading to more inflows even without a change in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.
*   **Inflows into DeFi:** Using the L1 asset as a deposit for collateral or liquidity, or higher yields incentivizing DeFi usage, all contribute to RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.
*   **Growing Asset Issuance:** More available on-chain assets that can be paired with the L1 token in DeFi (e.g., stablecoins, tokenized [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_analysis | Bitcoin]]) indicate potential future use and growth of RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.
*   **Monetary Attributes:** Reliable issuance policy, hardened protocol rules, and easy-to-verify chains highlight the strengths of digital crypto money relative to analog government money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.

### L2s and RSOV

[[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 2s]] (L2s) can be seen as beneficial for RSOV, even if they initially displace some Layer 1 transaction sequencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:59:00">[57:59:00]</a>. When users buy ETH and use it in DeFi on L2s like Base or Arbitrum, it still grows the realized value of ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:31:00">[58:31:00]</a>. [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | The importance of Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2 dynamics]] lies in their ability to onboard new capital, allowing people to buy and use ETH as a store of value, even if it doesn't always directly increase native yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.

## Total Addressable Market (TAM)

Valuing L1 tokens as money significantly expands their potential total addressable market (TAM).
Comparing digital crypto money ([[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_analysis | Bitcoin]], [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ether]], Solana, Ton, Tao) to analog and government base money (gold, US Dollar, Euro, Chinese Yen) reveals a massive opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The analog market is estimated at around $45 trillion, while digital crypto money currently stands at $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This suggests a potential 20x upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

This transition is still early, with [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_analysis | Bitcoin]] being about 20 years old and [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]] less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. As digital crypto monies are increasingly seen as credible stores of value, especially against fiat alternatives facing crises, they are expected to disrupt and potentially surpass their physical counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## Comparative Analysis of L1 Tokens using RSOV

The ratio of an L1 token's market cap to its RSOV can indicate how much future growth is currently priced in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>.
*   **[[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_analysis | Bitcoin]] and [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_analysis | Ethereum]]**: Tend to have lower Price-to-RSOV ratios (e.g., 2X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.
*   **Solana (SOL) and Ton (TON)**: Show higher ratios (e.g., 6X, 7X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>.
*   **Sui (SUI)**: Exhibits a significantly higher ratio (e.g., 185X), implying a very large bet by investors on its future growth in store of value usage (staking or DeFi) that hasn't yet materialized on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Censorship and Money Quality
> The ability of Sui validators to freeze funds after a hack demonstrates centralization that can negatively impact its perceived quality as a non-sovereign store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:15">[01:26:15]</a>. While Sui might still be considered "money" because of its usage, such censorship means it's "bad money" for those seeking uncensorable store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. This echoes how China reacted to the US freezing Russia's treasury holdings, leading them to buy gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>.

### Tribal Dynamics and Ethereum's Position

The crypto community often exhibits "tribal" dynamics, with some [[differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | Bitcoiners]] prioritizing stripping utility from the blockchain to emphasize its store of value aspect, while others, particularly newer L1s like Solana, focus on growing revenue/fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>. [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]], however, has historically sought to achieve both: being a Layer 1 store of value *and* having a fee burn mechanism. This synergistic approach, though complex, is seen as beneficial for [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum's Layer 1 versus Layer 2 dynamics]] and its overall value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:54">[01:29:54]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

L1 tokens create two primary "products":
1.  **Blockspace:** Valued via DCF/REV, subject to increasing supply and deflating fees.
2.  **Uncensorable, Non-State Store of Value Asset:** Valued via RSOV, driven by persistent demand and relatively constrained supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>.

The RSOV framework allows investors to assess which L1 tokens are relatively undervalued or overvalued based on their current "store of value" usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>. For instance, [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Ethereum]] might be seen as undervalued relative to [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_analysis | Bitcoin]] given its robust monetary attributes (censorship resistance, low inflation) and its extensive ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. [[challenges_ethereum_faces_in_the_crowded_layer_1_space | Challenges Ethereum faces in the crowded Layer 1 space]] are being addressed by developments like real-time proving and base rollups, which could significantly increase ETH's staking yield and attract more inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:54">[01:39:54]</a>.

This RSOV framework is considered a V1 and is open to community input for further improvements, especially in identifying and measuring additional store of value usages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[01:34:57]</a>.

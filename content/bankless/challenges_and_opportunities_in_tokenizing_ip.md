[[Tokenization of intellectual property IP on blockchain | Tokenizing intellectual property]] (IP) on a blockchain, as pursued by [[Story Protocols mission and its approach to IP | Story Protocol]], presents both significant challenges and transformative opportunities for the global IP landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. The core mission of [[Story Protocols mission and its approach to IP | Story Protocol]] is to put the world's IP on-chain, not just existing IP, but also to "unlock future potential, future IP, future content, and enable a net new era of human creativity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. The aim is for the protocol to become "the IP layer for the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Tokenizing IP

### Nature of IP and its Legal Framework
One of the primary challenges lies in the inherent nature of IP itself. Unlike discrete units such as shares or dollars, IP often has "fuzzy edges," where the exact boundaries of what constitutes an IP asset (e.g., a "Darth Vader lunchbox") are not always clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. Its definition is often determined on an "as needed basis by lawyers in a courtroom," making it subjective and subject to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

Furthermore, IP is "inherently a nation-state legal system construct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:09:00">[29:09:00]</a>. This contrasts with the ethos of blockchains, which are "not meant to cooperate necessarily with nation states" but rather "meant to be a layer higher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:19:00">[29:19:00]</a>. Different nation-states have varying interpretations and sources of truth regarding IP, particularly for patents and trademarks, posing difficulties for a transnational blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:02:00">[46:02:00]</a>.

### High Friction and Costs in Traditional IP Systems
The current IP system is characterized by "extremely high friction" and is "super costly, transaction inefficient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. Engaging in IP transactions typically requires hiring lawyers (costing upwards of $10,000), negotiating with licensing teams, and enduring auditing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. This prohibitive expense means "no one does anything with it outside of big corporations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. Similarly, [[benefits_of_tokenizing_media_for_creators | creators]] often receive very little revenue due to the numerous intermediaries like lawyers and agents, who all take a cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>.

### Enforcement and Credible Neutrality
While blockchain can streamline declaration and detection of IP use, perfect enforcement of IP rights is not the goal, as it would require a "surveillance state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:52:00">[42:52:00]</a>. The enforcement part of IP law remains largely "the mandate of the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:59:00">[46:59:00]</a>.

Furthermore, [[Story Protocols mission and its approach to IP | Story Protocol]] faces the challenge of establishing "credible neutrality." As a VC-backed startup, it's not an institutional conglomerate like Visa or Swift, which were created by banks to serve collective interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:04:00">[49:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:32:00">[49:32:00]</a>. This private interest might be perceived as a barrier when seeking widespread adoption by governments and traditional entities.

## Opportunities in Tokenizing IP

### Market Efficiency and Accessibility
IP represents a "multi-trillion dollar asset class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, estimated by the World Intellectual Property Organization to be $70 trillion in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. Yet, most individuals cannot easily access it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Blockchain offers the opportunity to create "unstoppable digital markets for new types of assets that can coordinate ownership at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

By bringing the "antiquated pen and paper system" on-chain and making it programmable, [[Tokenization of intellectual property IP on blockchain | tokenization of IP]] makes this massive market "a little bit more efficient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. This allows users to license IP via a simple API call or smart contract, enabling "liquid rights" and on-chain revenue streaming for auditing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

### Streamlining IP Management and Transactions
The goal is to eliminate layers of lawyers and agents from IP transactions, much like how previous market technology innovations streamlined financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. Smart contracts can act as a "better intermediary" than lawyers, creating "commitments in software that resemble almost like a legal contract" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>.

[[Story Protocols mission and its approach to IP | Story Protocol]] provides a "programmable IP license" that links the legal and on-chain systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>. Users can define IP terms (e.g., upfront fees, revenue share) on-chain, and a real legal contract is generated upon purchase of a license, offering a legal backstop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:00]</a>. This system allows for the creation of a secondary market for rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>.

### Facilitating a New Era of Creativity
The vision is to become an IP "payments network" or a "decentralized IP system," where creators supply IP, and applications demand it, creating a two-sided marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. This approach aims to provide "more clarity, more rigidity" around IP assets than currently exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.

The [[Role of AI and blockchain in transforming IP markets | role of AI and blockchain in transforming IP markets]] is crucial. AI can "filter out 99.9% of the edge cases" that previously required manual review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>, helping with infringement detection and offering "first line signal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:35:00">[42:35:00]</a>. By creating an efficient market with low transaction costs, IP holders can have "some skin in the game," and AI companies can build models without constant worry about licensing teams and lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.

The ultimate opportunity lies not just in tokenizing existing IP but in fostering "new types of IPs that are built to be decentralized, built to be built upon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>. This enables "increased human expressivity and creativity" by removing traditional barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:23:00">[56:23:00]</a>. The argument for IP rights, especially in an age of abundant content generated by AI, shifts from individual ownership to incentivizing "original ideas that are truly novel or inspiring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:52:00">[53:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>. Without incentives for new creation, even AI models will eventually "run out" of novel human content to train on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:20:00">[55:20:00]</a>.

### Bridging Traditional and Decentralized Systems
[[Story Protocols mission and its approach to IP | Story Protocol]] adopts a "stablecoin approach" to IP, similar to how stablecoins extend the utility of the US dollar on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:08:00">[32:08:00]</a>. By making existing copyright law more efficient on-chain, it serves as a ladder for broader adoption of crypto principles, paving the way for a future where "code should be law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56:00">[34:56:00]</a>. The long-term vision is an "IP settlement" network, like a decentralized Visa or Mastercard for IP, that operates as a shared standard across legal jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:21:00">[47:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:00">[47:48:00]</a>. This approach makes it easier to transact IP value across borders due to the harmonization of copyright law principles across major nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:15:00">[47:15:00]</a>.

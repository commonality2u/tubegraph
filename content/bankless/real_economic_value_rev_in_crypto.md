From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Crypto Twitter has recently engaged in discussions surrounding Real Economic Value (REV) in the context of blockchain networks, a conversation sparked by a tweet from John Sharbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While the concept isn't entirely new, its renewed prominence highlights an ongoing effort to establish robust [[valuation_models_for_blockchain_networks | valuation models for blockchain networks]] within the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Defining REV

REV, in this context, refers to the real economic value generated by a network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. It encompasses all network fees and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) tips that users pay to interact with a given blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This definition is distinct from "Realized Extractable Value," a term previously used by Flashbots, as the latter does not include base fees, which constitute the majority of [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]]'s historical REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Historical Observations and Market Behavior

Historically, John Sharbon's analysis revealed that both [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]] and [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Solana]] traded at similar multiples to their annualized REV at their respective all-time high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These peaks coincided with the networks' highest points of REV generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

This correlation presents a dual interpretation:
*   **Rational Valuation**: The market might be trading rationally, with prices rising as networks generate more revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Correlation**: High prices and high on-chain activity lead to more fees and MEV, suggesting a correlation rather than direct causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

While not explicitly valuing tokens based on cash flows like [[evaluating_crypto_with_traditional_finance_models | traditional finance models]] for equities, REV is becoming an increasingly important factor for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## REV as a Valuation Metric

REV can be understood in two primary ways, both analogous to [[evaluating_crypto_with_traditional_finance_models | traditional finance models]]:

1.  **Value Capture Metric**: In a proof-of-stake network, token holders are entitled to receive all REV generated by the network, whether through burns or dividends to stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This makes REV similar to a topline revenue metric for a traditional company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
2.  **Demand Indicator**: REV directly measures what users are willing to pay to use a given network, focusing exclusively on network-level fees and MEV tips, not app-level fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. It serves as a signal of fundamental demand for a blockchain's blockspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Application Across Blockchains

The relevance of REV varies between different blockchain types:
*   **Smart Contract Platforms**: For platforms like [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]] and [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Solana]], REV is highly relevant due to the utility value of their block space driven by decentralized applications (dApps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This "utility value" is a key component of their ecosystem's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin**: Bitcoin, which focuses on being a monetary asset, generates zero REV in this sense and is therefore not valued by this metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## The REV Debate and Tribal Lines

The discussion around REV often falls along tribal lines, particularly between the [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]] and [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Solana]] communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

### Ethereum's Perspective
Some within the [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]] community tend to diminish REV's importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. This is partly due to [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]]'s historical focus on "holding state" and providing long-term verifiability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. While recognizing REV's role, they argue it's not the complete picture and doesn't fully represent [[evaluating_crypto_with_traditional_finance_models | Ethereum]]'s value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. [[evaluating_crypto_with_traditional_finance_models | Ethereum]]'s high historical REV was mainly from base fees due to network congestion, not contentious state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.

### Solana's Perspective
[[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Solana]] is often more dominantly valued by REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>, as it optimizes for "state transitions" â€“ rapid and efficient trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Solana]]'s REV comes from MEV and priority fees, indicative of contentious state access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>. The market sees [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Solana]] as "winning" due to user and developer adoption, particularly in areas like [[value_surges_of_trump_coin | memecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.

### Correlation vs. Causation Revisited
The all-time highs for REV on both [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]] and [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Solana]] coincided with periods of intense on-chain activity: [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]]'s peak REV occurred when ETH was the money for NFTs, and [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Solana]]'s when SOL was the money for [[value_surges_of_trump_coin | memecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This suggests that high transaction demand and the use of the native asset as a unit of account go hand-in-hand with REV generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

## The Future of REV and Crypto Valuation

The broader challenge in crypto is that "no one knows how to value this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. However, REV, as a measure of cash flows, represents the "minimum intrinsic value" of these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The question is whether crypto assets will gravitate towards this baseline, similar to how equities converge on their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Currently, many large crypto assets remain "pretty divorced" from this REV-based valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. For example, Aptos has traded at a 1000x multiple to its REV, whereas [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]] and [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Solana]] were around 26x at their peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This suggests significant growth is being priced in, or that REV is only one component of a larger [[valuation_models_for_blockchain_networks | valuation model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### The Role of Applications and Abstraction
In the future, the revenue streams might shift more towards the application layer. While REV could approach zero for the blockchain, the success of dApps could still be bullish for the native token if it remains the primary medium of exchange or if its block space is in high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Apps will likely try to internalize more of the value currently captured as MEV and priority fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

The abstraction of gas payments and the use of stablecoins like USDC could also impact the direct demand for native assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. However, the "crypto-native" users and developers, who often prefer using the native currency, are seen as drivers of excitement and energy on a chain, potentially dictating how value is ultimately derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

### Real World Assets and Monetization
The influx of Real World Assets (RWAs) onto chains presents another unknown. While cryptonative fervor (like NFT summer or [[value_surges_of_trump_coin | memecoin]] trading) has strongly boosted native asset prices, the effect of large amounts of stablecoins (like $150 billion on [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]]) has been "lackluster" for the asset's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. It's unclear what a trillion dollars in on-chain RWAs would do to the local currency of a blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

### Infrastructure vs. Applications
There's a growing sentiment that while infrastructure (layer 1s) might be overpriced based purely on DCF/REV models, the future value lies more in applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. Platforms that offer "fast and cheap" execution environments will attract traders and developers, regardless of the specific application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[current_state_of_the_crypto_market_and_consensus | crypto market]] is still in its nascent stage regarding [[the_role_of_fundamentals_in_crypto_valuation | fundamental valuation]]. While REV offers a tangible, quantifiable metric, it's widely acknowledged as only one piece of the puzzle, alongside other factors like monetary properties, network effects, and speculative demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

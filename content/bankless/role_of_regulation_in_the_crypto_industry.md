From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The crypto industry has historically operated with a low barrier to entry and a permissionless nature, which, while fostering innovation, has also led to significant instances of fraud and market manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. This environment often brings forth "grifters" who exploit these characteristics to extract value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

## Consequences of Unregulated Activity

Recent events, such as the launch and subsequent collapse of the Libra token, illustrate the risks associated with an unregulated environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The Libra token, launched on Valentine's Day via a tweet from Javier Milei, saw its valuation skyrocket to $5.5 billion within 30 minutes before crashing to $30 million within 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Key issues included:
*   **Centralized Holdings:** 82% of the Libra token supply was held in one cluster of wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** No tokenomics were shared before its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Front-Running and Sniping:** Individuals like Hayden Davies, who admitted to front-running the Libra supply, highlighted a "tactical decision" to snipe the supply ahead of other snipers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This situation seemed akin to the FTX post-collapse "publicity tour" where a figure might not comprehend their legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Influence Peddling:** Hayden Davies reportedly gained access to Javier Milei through his sister, sending her money and exercising control, leading to the presidential tweet promoting the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Insider Information:** Dave Portnoy was reportedly paid Libra tokens by Hayden Davies to promote the coin before its launch, giving him [[insider_information | insider information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. He returned the tokens but bought the token early, eventually being refunded his losses by Hayden Davies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Industrialization of Meme Coin Launches:** The Libra incident is seen as an exposure of the "industrialization of the meme coin launch," where a lack of rules and guardrails allows grifters to exploit the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This is a recurring pattern in crypto, seen in ICOs, DeFi Summer, and NFTs, where initial fair launches end up being gamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

> "What started off as like a relatively Fair fun casino of memec coin launches that was a reaction to the high FD low float meta actually turned into having something with like no rules no [[regulation_and_legal_implications_for_cryptocurrency | regulations]] no guard rails and once again the grifters come in figure out how to game the system and blow it up for the rest of us and this is a pattern that we've seen in crypto time and time again." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>

The unregulated nature allowed for significant financial losses, with an estimated $6 billion erased from the meme coin market after the Liberty token launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

## The SEC's Increased Focus on Crypto

The United States [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] has announced the creation of a "Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit" to protect retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. This unit aims to combat fraud committed using:
*   Emerging technologies like AI and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.
*   Social media, the dark web, or false websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.
*   Hacking to obtain material non-public information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.
*   Blockchain technology and crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

This initiative is seen as a move to crack down on fraud, even outside of traditional [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] transaction purview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

## The Debate: Regulation vs. Self-Policing

There is a significant debate within the crypto community regarding the role of [[regulation_changes_in_the_crypto_industry | regulation]].
*   **Arguments for Regulation:** Supporters argue that strong enforcement is necessary to weed out fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. Past crypto "metas" like ICOs, DeFi Summer, NFTs, and meme coins, despite legitimate beginnings, all ended with significant fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Arguments Against Overregulation:** Critics warn about the unintended consequences of overregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>. The analogy of a "fraud dial" suggests that aiming for "zero fraud" in a complex system like a bank or the crypto industry is unrealistic and could lead to shutting down the entire operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. Regulatory agencies can also be "co-opted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

> "The unintended consequences of giving [[regulatory_changes_and_their_implications_for_the_crypto_industry | Regulators]] too much power uh is is very dangerous it doesn't necessarily even stop the fraud and it can create far far wider unattended consequences." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>

Concerns are raised that while current [[regulatory_developments_in_the_united_states_impacting_the_crypto_industry | SEC]] commissioners like Hester Peirce might be crypto-positive, future leadership could use these new tools to "choke out" the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.

## Industry's Responsibility

Ultimately, many believe the crypto industry has a "direct responsibility" to "sort our own shit out" rather than solely relying on external bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>. There is a need for the industry to develop an "immune system that protects against these things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a> and to "self-police" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. This includes identifying bad actors and not allowing platforms to be co-opted for "extraction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

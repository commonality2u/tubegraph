[[cost_reduction_in_space_transport | Cheap space travel]] is anticipated to unlock numerous advancements that will ultimately improve the quality of life for the average person on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Shawn Maguire, a Sequoia Capital [[frontier_technologies_and_their_impact | Frontier Tech]] investor, suggests that staying at the cutting edge of space technology is crucial for America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Frontier Technologies and Investment

Maguire, whose childhood obsession with space led him to invest in companies like [[future_of_space_exploration_with_spacex | SpaceX]], highlights space exploration as a key area of [[frontier_technologies_and_their_impact | frontier technology]] that is poised to reshape the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. He has even invested in a company that aims to turn night into day by beaming light rays back at Earth from satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Manufacturing and Supply Chains in Space

[[future_of_space_exploration_with_spacex | SpaceX]] is noted as one of the leading companies in America excelling in manufacturing, even outperforming China in its field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. [[future_of_space_exploration_with_spacex | Elon Musk]] is specifically mentioned for building his own vertically integrated supply chains for companies like [[future_of_space_exploration_with_spacex | SpaceX]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

The strategy of [[future_of_space_exploration_with_spacex | SpaceX]] involved starting with initial, less complex vehicles like the Falcon 1, proving their capability, and then iteratively improving to achieve advanced reusable rockets like the Falcon 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. This approach allowed them to become best-in-class in their categories while controlling their own supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

A significant outcome of this vertical integration is [[future_of_space_exploration_with_spacex | SpaceX]]'s expansion into areas like PCB (Printed Circuit Board) assembly for Starlink user terminals, a process that can catalyze entire new supply chains and ecosystems in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Maguire believes that America needs to develop about 10 more companies like [[future_of_space_exploration_with_spacex | SpaceX]] and Tesla, which are vertically integrated and primarily manufacture in the West, to revitalize the nation's manufacturing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This strategy focuses on investing in nascent or relatively new areas, such as silicon photonics, where America can gain a competitive edge rather than trying to catch up in mature manufacturing sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.

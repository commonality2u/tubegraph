## Bitcoin's Current Status

Bitcoin is currently up 8% on the week. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> At the time of recording, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $111,300, with a new record to beat at $111,512. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> Bitcoin is now a $2 trillion asset. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> The supply of Bitcoin on exchanges is noted as "super low," which is considered bullish for the asset. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>

### Concentration of Wealth

One commentator noted that 95% of their liquid net worth is invested in the top two crypto assets, a highly concentrated bet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> This strategy echoes legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller's unconventional approach to risk control: "putting all my eggs in one basket and then watching the basket very carefully." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

## Historical Context: Bitcoin Pizza Day

May 22nd, 2010, marks Bitcoin Pizza Day, commemorating the first real-world commerce transaction involving Bitcoin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> Laszlo Hanyecz posted on the Bitcoin Talk forums offering to buy pizza with Bitcoin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> An individual agreed to send two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> These two pizzas, which did not appear to be of high quality, were purchased for what is now worth $1.2 billion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> The first use case of Bitcoin was as a medium of exchange, not a store of value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>

## Bitcoin Dominance and Altcoin Season

Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin's market capitalization as a ratio of all other crypto assets, currently stands at approximately 63%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> This dominance has been increasing since 2023. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

The prevailing question in the [[crypto_market_trends_and_sentiment | crypto market]] is whether an "alt season" will occur. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> Previous bull markets, such as from December 2020 to January 2021, saw a significant decrease in Bitcoin dominance, leading to massive run-ups in other cryptocurrencies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> Investor Arthur Hayes suggests an alt season will happen, though it "may not be your alts." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>

Ethereum, despite being the most legitimate number two cryptocurrency, is currently considered an "alt" due to its 15% market share compared to Bitcoin's 64%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> The term "alt" generally refers to assets downstream from Bitcoin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>

Ethereum's price is up 4.5% on the week, marking the first week it has performed less than Bitcoin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> The supply of ETH on centralized exchanges has dropped below 4.9%, suggesting easier price movement with incoming capital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> An increase in the ETH/BTC ratio is expected during alt seasons. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>

## Macroeconomic Factors and Bitcoin

The performance of the United States bond market is seen as a factor influencing Bitcoin's all-time high. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> Recently, there has been "tepid demand" for US Treasury auctions, showing investor jitters about the national debt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> Long-duration bond yields, such as the US 30-year treasuries, have spiked above 5%, levels not seen since 2007. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>

The US federal debt has surged to $36 trillion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a> Two-thirds of this debt is held by US investors, and about one-third by foreign investors like Japan and China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a> Investors are demanding higher rates due to concerns about unsustainable debt, which has been exacerbated by actions like Trump's tariffs that reduced international demand for US bonds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> Instead of buying US bonds, foreign entities are increasingly buying gold and Bitcoin, contributing to their all-time highs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a> This shift suggests a "limbo period" where capital is parked while investors seek the next epicenter of finance, potentially in credibly neutral, internet-based financial systems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a> Moody's also recently downgraded US sovereign debt again. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>

## Bitcoin Unit Renaming Debate

Jack Dorsey is advocating for a rebranding of Bitcoin's smallest unit of account. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a> Historically called a Satoshi (SAT), Dorsey believes this nomenclature is not catching on and suggests "bits" or "bitcoins" as alternatives, with "bits" being preferred due to its conceptual similarity to data units (a bit is smaller than a byte). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a> BIP 177 is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that formally suggests making one Satoshi equal one Bitcoin, simplifying the base unit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a> However, this is largely a social change that would only become critical if Bitcoin's value significantly increased, making its smaller units more practical for everyday transactions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>

## Texas and Bitcoin Reserve

Texas has officially passed a bill to create its own strategic Bitcoin reserve. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a> This dedicated fund, managed by the state controller, is authorized to invest in any crypto asset with a market cap above $500 billion, potentially including Ether if it reaches that threshold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a> This move aims to strengthen Texas's fiscal sovereignty and position it as a forward-thinking state in global finance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>

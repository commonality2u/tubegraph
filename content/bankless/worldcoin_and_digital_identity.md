Worldcoin is a project that is rolling out its Orb technology in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The initiative is presented as a potential solution for verifying human identity in an era of increasing [[sovereign_ai_and_its_implications_in_the_crypto_space | AI bot propaganda]] and artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Overview and Purpose
As [[sovereign_ai_and_its_implications_in_the_crypto_space | AI]] becomes more prevalent and sophisticated, concerns about distinguishing humans from bots online are growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. Worldcoin aims to address this by providing a protocol for on-chain identity verification built for privacy and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The project's proponents suggest it could be a "civilizational" need to combat issues like bot armies that can manipulate public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.

## How it Works
Worldcoin's core technology involves:
-   **The Orb**: A device used for iris scanning to verify an individual's unique human identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Users physically interact with the Orb by looking into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.
-   **World ID**: The digital identity generated after a successful iris scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.
-   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: The Self protocol, which is integrated with Worldcoin, uses ZKPs to confirm identity safely without revealing sensitive personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. The system generates cryptographic proofs and never stores raw biometric data like eyeball pictures, only a hash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. Each biometric passport creates one unique identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
-   **World App**: After being "orbed," users can access the World App <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>, which is reportedly boasting the crypto's most active application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. The app will support USDC transactions via Circle and integrate Stripe for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

## U.S. Rollout and Incentives
Worldcoin is establishing a "boots on the ground" brand in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a> with plans to deploy Orbs in six major cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. These deployments include a series of Apple-like in-person stores where individuals can go to get "orbed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

New users who get their iris scanned will receive 16 World Tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. Existing users receive a pioneer grant of 150 World Tokens, valued at approximately $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

## Partnerships and Use Cases
Worldcoin has announced collaborations to integrate World ID, including with Visa, Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>, and Match Group (which owns dating apps like Match.com, Hinge, and Tinder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. The integration with Match Group aims to verify users as humans, not bots, on dating platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. Additionally, the World App will offer access to Kalshi's prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.

## Dystopian Concerns and Counterarguments
The concept of biometric iris scanning and the visual nature of the Orb has led to perceptions of Worldcoin as dystopian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. Critics question why people need to be paid to participate if the technology is inherently beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. The connection to Sam Altman, who is also a leader in [[sovereign_ai_and_its_implications_in_the_crypto_space | AI]] development, adds to these concerns, with some viewing it as the "arsonist and the firefighter at the same time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.

However, supporters argue that these concerns are "overblown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. They emphasize that the project's security practices, such as only creating a hash from iris scans and discarding the data, make the "dystopian nature" more cosmetic than fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. As the proliferation of [[sovereign_ai_and_its_implications_in_the_crypto_space | AI]] bots and propaganda becomes a more tangible threat, the utility of a human identity verification system like Worldcoin is increasingly recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

The first week of May saw discussions in the crypto space turn to macroeconomics, particularly the potential for a tariff-driven recession and its [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | impact on crypto markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Current Gross Domestic Product (GDP) numbers are not looking favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, prompting investors to consider significant macro catalysts.

## Recession Probability and Economic Indicators

The probability of a recession in 2025 is currently priced at 62% by PolyMarket, indicating a high likelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Recent Q1 GDP numbers were negative 0.3%, missing the consensus expectation of 0.3% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This 0.6% miss is largely attributed to the unexpected implementation of tariffs during Q1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

A baseline 10% tariff is now generally in place, with the Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, stating this is the "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A decision point on July 9th could see tariffs increase for trade partners like the EU, South Korea, and Switzerland if ongoing negotiations don't yield deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The [[trumps_tariff_strategy_and_its_impacts | tariff war with China]] is also an ongoing part of a broader geopolitical struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

An Apollo report predicts a summertime recession in 2025, detailing a chain of events:
*   April 2nd Liberation Day tariffs lead to container ships stopping at US ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   Trucking demand halts by late May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   Layoffs in trucking and retail begin in early June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   This culminates in a summer 2025 recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Impact on Crypto Markets

A recession is generally considered negative for crypto in the short term, as crypto assets typically behave as "risk-on" assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. However, there are other factors that could influence crypto's long-term trajectory.

### American Capital Flight
The possibility of American capital flight is a significant trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. When US stocks and bonds decline, and the dollar weakens, gold tends to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Gold was up 33% on the year at the time of reporting, suggesting capital is moving away from traditional US stores of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Historically, the US has served as the global store of value through its treasury bills and stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Bitcoin has shown a tendency to trade more like gold since the tariff announcements, shifting its position between tracking the NASDAQ and tracking gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This aligns with the long-standing crypto thesis of Bitcoin serving as a credibly neutral alternative to traditional fiat monetary systems and a new property rights system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. While tariffs are seen as short-term negatives, this capital flight could be a long-term positive for Bitcoin and potentially the broader crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Increasing Global Money Supply
Another catalyst is the increasing global money supply (M2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. After a cycle of decreasing global monetary liquidity, the system is now bottoming out and starting a new cycle of increasing M2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

According to Ray Dalio, the world is on the brink of a new monetary order due to unsustainable fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. The rebalancing of trade imbalances, such as China's reduced dependence on US debt and the US's reduced dependence on Chinese manufacturing, will cause economic pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. In response to this pain, governments are expected to turn on the money printers, leading to increased fiat currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

This scenario aligns with the Bitcoiner thesis on [[impact_of_monetary_policy_on_cryptocurrencies | monetary policy]], suggesting that increased money printing and isolationist policies will make a credibly neutral, permissionless, and open monetary system like crypto more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. While a short-term recession might occur, the long-term outlook (12 months and beyond) for crypto appears bullish due to these macroeconomic trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The discussion surrounding Ethereum's valuation and identity often centers on its transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), particularly following the implementation of EIP-1559 and The Merge. This shift has inadvertently altered the predominant narrative around [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH the asset]], leading to a re-evaluation of its fundamental nature.

## The Two Valuation Frameworks

In economics, there are generally two primary ways to value an asset:
*   **Fundamentals View (Discounted Cash Flow - DCF):** This approach values an asset based on its claim to future cash flows. It treats the asset similarly to equity in a company, where its value is derived from the revenue or profit it generates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
*   **Commodity View:** This perspective values an asset based on its inherent properties, utility, and supply/demand dynamics, independent of cash flows. Examples include gold, which is valued for industrial uses, and its role as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

While mixtures exist, Ethereum's post-Merge state has increasingly pushed [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] into a DCF-centric discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

## Ethereum's Shift: PoS and EIP-1559

Ethereum officially transitioned from PoW to PoS in September 2022 with The Merge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This change, coupled with EIP-1559 (implemented earlier), fundamentally altered how [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH the asset]] is perceived, even if the underlying technology remained robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. EIP-1559 introduced a mechanism where a portion of transaction fees is burned, effectively reducing the supply of [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] and creating a deflationary pressure. For many, this burn mechanism became analogous to a company's revenue or dividend, leading to [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_versus_a_cash_flow_asset | discussions about ETH as a cash flow asset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

This focus on [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_versus_a_cash_flow_asset | ETH's cash flow]] capabilities, while technologically impressive, has inadvertently led to a focus on its "floor price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. When the market primarily evaluates [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] through a DCF lens, it anchors its valuation to the minimum expected value derived from transaction fees, potentially leading to a lower price point, estimated by some to be around $500-$600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Counter-Example: The PoW "Superpower"

Bitcoin, operating on a PoW consensus mechanism with a fixed supply of 21 million units, provides a stark contrast. Its "superpower" lies in the inherent difficulty of applying a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to its valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. There are no "cash flows" in the traditional sense, and its fixed supply naturally guides the narrative towards its scarcity and [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | identity]] as a pure store of value. This structural characteristic forces its community to focus on its commodity nature, avoiding the pitfalls of DCF valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

A thought experiment suggests that even if Bitcoin were to integrate a mechanism similar to EIP-1559 (e.g., BIP1559) where fees were burned, the Bitcoin community would likely not shift its primary narrative to a DCF model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. Their strong social consensus around Bitcoin as a store of value would likely override any temptation to frame it as an equity-like asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

The decline in the ETH/BTC ratio since The Merge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a> is attributed not to the technical merits of PoS over PoW, but to the shift in the social narrative and [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | valuation framework for ETH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

## The Socially Constructed Nature of Value

The valuation of digital assets, especially those like [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]], is largely a [[the_role_of_social_consensus_in_valuing_ethereum | socially constructed definition]] rather than a mere marketing effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. If a community, including developers, investors, and institutions, collectively agrees on how an asset is defined, that definition becomes its reality. For instance, if everyone agrees an asset is a "store of value," it functionally becomes one, influencing its market behavior and perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

The Ethereum community has struggled with a unified [[the_role_of_social_consensus_in_valuing_ethereum | social consensus]] on [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH's identity]]. While the technology flourishes and improves [[security_and_stability_in_the_ethereum_network | security and stability]], the asset's value proposition gets muddied by diverse and sometimes conflicting narratives (e.g., "ultrasound money" vs. "DCF asset") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. This lack of a clear, unified definition creates a "chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a> that can negatively impact [[the_importance_of_holding_eth | ETH's price]] relative to assets with clearer, more singular narratives like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

## Rebalancing the Narrative for ETH

While Ethereum's technological advancements, such as the [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 2]] roadmap and scaling efforts, are widely praised and beneficial for the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>, they do not automatically translate to a higher value for [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH the asset]] if its primary valuation framework remains DCF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

The challenge for the Ethereum community is to achieve a dual identity:
1.  **Technological Flexibility:** The Ethereum [[ethereums_consensus_layer_and_validator_changes | technology layer]] needs to be adaptable, pragmatic, and open to innovation (e.g., scaling Layer 1, supporting Layer 2s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.
2.  **Asset Maximalism:** [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH the asset]] needs a more focused, "maximalist" narrative, emphasizing its commodity-like [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | identity]] and status as a store of value, similar to how Bitcoin's community reinforces its 21 million hard cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.

This means being "nice, pluralistic, and open" on the technology front, but "unforgiving" and "maximalist" when defining [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH the asset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>. For example, a social commitment that the [[ethereums_consensus_layer_and_validator_changes | ETH emission algorithm]] will never change—similar to Bitcoin's fixed supply schedule—could help solidify its commodity status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.

If this balance is struck, [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] could potentially achieve a much higher valuation against Bitcoin, moving beyond its current "floor price" dictated by DCF models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. However, failing to define this "socially constructed" identity risks continued underperformance of [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH the asset]], even as [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_versus_a_cash_flow_asset | Ethereum the technology]] thrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

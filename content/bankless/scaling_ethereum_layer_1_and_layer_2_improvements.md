Ethereum's ongoing development is focused on accelerating upgrades and prioritizing product mindfulness, with a clear direction articulated by the Ethereum Foundation's (EF) new co-executive directors, Tamas and Shiae. This shift aims to enhance Ethereum's operational leadership and accelerate upgrade cadences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Core Objectives for Ethereum's Future

The Ethereum Foundation has outlined three key objectives for the next phase of Ethereum's development, aiming for a more product-centric ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>:
1.  [[scaling_the_layer_1_blockchain | Scaling the Ethereum Layer 1]] (L1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>
2.  [[impact_of_ethereum_scaling_on_layer_2s | Scaling blobs for Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>
3.  Improving user experience (UX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>

These objectives are intended to clarify Ethereum's direction and have been positively received by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.

### Scaling Ethereum Layer 1

[[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Scaling the Ethereum Layer 1]] is a primary focus, demonstrating a commitment to making Ethereum's mainnet stronger and ensuring it continues to outperform competitors in quality, decentralization, security, and throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. The goal is to achieve significant performance improvements:
*   **3x scaling** this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>
*   **10x scaling** next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>
*   **100x scaling** over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>

This ambitious scaling roadmap is being anchored by restructuring protocol development and research efforts around these targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>.

### Scaling Blobs for Layer 2s

[[impact_of_ethereum_scaling_on_layer_2s | Scaling blobs]] is a direct expression of general support for the [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2 ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. Layer 2s are seen as a massive success for Ethereum in bringing users and rely on Layer 1 for security and core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. This strategy reinforces the symbiotic [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | relationship between Layer 1 and Layer 2s]], where the strength of L1 enables L2s to provide safety and decentralization to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

### Improving User Experience (UX)

Improving UX addresses concerns about the [[layer_1_and_layer_2_integration_in_ethereum | L2L1 relationship]] not feeling like a single chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>. UX encompasses:
*   **Interoperability standards**: Facilitating seamless interactions between L1 and Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Security**: Ensuring users feel comfortable and secure using the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.
*   **Latency of blocks**: Improving pre-confirmations and trading speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Developer Experience (DevX)**: Ensuring builders view Ethereum as a robust platform with great tooling, clear roadmaps, and strong support for launching products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.

This focus signifies Ethereum's shift towards a product-centric approach, where changes are driven by user needs and co-designed with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

## Accelerating Upgrade Cadence

Historically, Ethereum's hard forks occurred every 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. The new target is to ship hard forks every **six months** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>. This acceleration reflects a commitment to faster delivery and responsiveness to ecosystem needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>.

Current and Upcoming Hard Forks:
*   **Pectra**: Expected to ship around May 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. It focuses on staking changes (mass max effective balance) and significant UX improvements via ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:45">[01:27:45]</a>.
*   **Fusaka**: Devnets for Fusaka are planned to spawn immediately after May 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>. The goal is to deliver it by September or October, aiming for a five-month timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>.
*   **Glamsterdam**: Planned for March to June of the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>, with a focus on [[scaling_the_layer_1_blockchain | L1 scaling acceleration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:20">[01:29:20]</a>.

### Addressing Development Challenges: The EOF Debate

A notable example of development challenges is the debate around EOF (EVM Object Format). Ethereum researchers and developers have debated EOF for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Although initially considered for Pectra, it was removed at the last minute because it was deemed "not ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This caused frustration among developers who had invested significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

EOF's removal was for Fusaka, not Pectra, which is scheduled for six months later, not a last-minute decision for an immediate release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. The issue highlights a "lack of capacity to decide" within the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>. The community and application builders expressed concerns that EOF was not what they needed and requested other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.

> "The fault is not about doing or not doing EOF. The fault is about the lack of capacity to decide." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>

The new leadership aims to fix this by empowering decision-makers, encouraging faster execution, and involving application developers earlier in the EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) planning stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. This includes actively seeking out dissenting opinions to build features that are overwhelmingly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.

## Ethereum Foundation's New Leadership

Tamas and Shiae, the new co-executive directors, aim to bring greater operational leadership to the Ethereum Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. Their vision is to enhance the EF's role as a steward of the ecosystem, stepping up when most needed and empowering other players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.

### Leadership Approach

*   **Clarity and Purpose**: Shiae emphasizes leading with clarity, moving with purpose, and building without attachment to personal legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The focus is on creating the world Ethereum wants to live in, beyond just being a product, and balancing growth with core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Operational Excellence**: Tamas brings energy and experience in building organizations, accelerating internal processes, and improving communication within the foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. He aims to empower team leaders, give them voice, and help them understand where differences in vision lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Communication and Openness**: The EF is shifting from less frequent communication about roadmaps to actively engaging with the community, inviting feedback, and not avoiding difficult questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Product-Centricity**: The EF will focus on defining structures to include product conversations in development (e.g., restructuring ACD calls) and establishing clear channels to engage with stakeholders about various aspects of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.

### Out of Scope for the EF

While the community often has high expectations, the EF clarifies its boundaries:
*   **Not a centralized company**: The EF is a non-profit organization, not a CEO-led company like Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Funding**: The EF sells ETH to fund operations and grants, which can sometimes be misunderstood by the community who expect them to hold ETH exclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.
*   **Direct engineering**: The EF does not directly build consensus or execution layer clients; these are developed by separate client teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>.
*   **Market making/Business Development**: The EF is not responsible for market activities like buying more ETH or directly engaging in traditional business development (e.g., talking to Wall Street) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. However, they aim to be active in helping organizations connect, find customers, talent, and research, acting as a "business developer" in a supportive, rather than coordinating, sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>.
*   **Ownership**: The EF does not act as the owner of the Ethereum protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Their role is to empower others to make decisions and foster a decentralized environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

The EF believes it should step in "where there's nobody" to help new organizations appear or highlight missing elements in the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This includes facilitating the "network of the social layer" within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

Overall, the new leadership is focused on making Ethereum a fast-moving juggernaut by combining the strength of talented people within the EF and the broader community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

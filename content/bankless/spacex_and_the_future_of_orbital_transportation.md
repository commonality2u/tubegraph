For approximately 30 to 40 years, progress in space exploration largely [[stalled_progress_in_space_exploration | stalled]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prolonged period of stagnation has led to a poor public intuition about the potential for exponential progress in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Drastic Cost Reduction

The cost per kilogram to orbit remained stagnant for about 30 years, hovering around $100,000 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. SpaceX, with its Starship vehicle, is poised to dramatically alter this landscape. Once Starship is fully reusable, it is projected to reduce the cost to approximately $20 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents an unprecedented [[cost_reduction_in_space_travel | 50,000x reduction]] in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Exponential Increase in Payload Capacity

Beyond just the cost, the amount of material that can be placed in space has historically been very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, within the next decade, the capability to launch material into space is expected to see a massive increase. Projections indicate that roughly a million times more material per year could be sent into space compared to two decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This signifies a monumental leap in [[increased_capabilities_in_space_payloads | payload capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The "Railroad to Space" Era

The combination of a 50,000x reduction in cost and a million-fold increase in the amount of material that can be sent to space draws parallels to transformative historical periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

This is basically the same thing. We are going to have railroad to space. We're going from horserawn carriages to space to railroad space." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>

This transformation is akin to the [[comparison_of_space_developments_to_the_railroad_era | early railroad era]], shifting from risky and expensive horse-drawn carriage travel across America to a system enabling the easy, comfortable, and cheap transport of vast quantities of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This marks the transition from "horserawn carriages to space" to "railroad space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

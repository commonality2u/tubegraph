The **AI rollup** is a platform dedicated to staying up-to-speed with emerging trends and developments in the [[ai_and_crypto_convergence | AI crypto space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article explores the evolving landscape where traditional AI innovations increasingly influence and integrate with decentralized crypto applications.

## Shifting Focus in the Crypto Industry

The crypto industry is moving away from a period of "financial nihilism" characterized by numerous meme coin launches and "pump and dumps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. While the [[crypto_ai_sector_developments | crypto AI sector]] initially saw tokens born out of this meme coin mania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, there's a growing sentiment towards innovation and fundamental building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The "hot air" of speculation is deflating, leaving behind builders convicted in the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This shift benefits the [[influence_of_ai_on_the_crypto_industry | AI sector]] because advances in AI models enhance the capabilities of [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI agents]] and startups in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Developments in Traditional AI (Trad AI)

The traditional AI world continues to see significant activity, with major AI labs driving innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Grok 3's Performance
X.ai, Elon Musk's AI sector (formerly Twitter AI), released Grok 3, which has reportedly "blown people's mind" and outperformed other models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. It competes at the same standard, and in some cases, much better than OpenAI's models (e.g., OpenAI 03 Mini and full models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Grok 3 scored over 1,400 on Chatbot Arena, surpassing publicly available reasoning models from OpenAI and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This demonstrates that "scrappy teams" can make significant advancements ahead of entrenched incumbents like OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Shift Towards Open Source in Trad AI
While Grok 3 is not immediately open-source (Grok 2 was open-sourced after Grok 3's release) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, there's a noticeable shift in "Trad AI" towards more open-source development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The time gap between proprietary models and equivalent open-source versions is rapidly shrinking from months to weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This means the capabilities of AI models are increasing, making it easier for those building in the [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI crypto space]] to create powerful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Crypto AI Innovation and Open Source

The crypto space is contributing to open-source AI development with unique approaches.

### News Research and Hera-3
News Research, an open-source AI research team rooted in crypto, released their Hera-3 Preview, a new Large Language Model (LLM) that unifies reasoning and intuitive language model capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This model, similar to DeepSeek AI, utilizes groundbreaking techniques like reinforcement learning with reasoning data, making it openly accessible and hostable on decentralized compute networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. A key differentiator of Hera-3, and a common goal for the open-source AI community, is its less censored and more candid responses compared to heavily curated models like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. For example, while ChatGPT refuses to answer "how to hotwire a car," open-source alternatives like Venice AI will provide instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

## AI Agents and Computer Control

The emergence of AI agents capable of interacting with computers marks a significant step in [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI and crypto convergence]].

### Microsoft's Open-Source Agent Tool
Microsoft has released an open-source tool that transforms AI models into agents capable of using a user's computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. These agents can see what the user sees, monitor tasks, and even perform transactions, turning any AI model into a fully functional agent hosted on a local device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

### Trust and Implications of Computer Use
The prospect of AI agents having control over one's computer raises significant trust concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. However, this "computer use" functionality is a growing trend among major AI companies like OpenAI (with its Agent product) and Anthropic (with Claude AI), as well as crypto companies like Agent Tank and Limitless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This trend suggests that computer control by AI agents is becoming standard.

The concept of AI agents as an "attack vector" is a concern, especially when personal information might be revealed, as illustrated by the "Date Abby" LLM on Valentine's Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. The increasing realism of AI interactions, including voice, could lead to even more significant information disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

### Agent-on-Agent Interaction
A novel development is the pairing of AI agents to perform tasks, such as OpenAI's Agent Starter Kit interacting with the Repl.it app (an AI tool for building apps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. This allows agents to "talk to each other" and rapidly build software without human intervention, operating at speeds far exceeding human capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. This "nesting doll" of agents raises concerns about alignment and unintended outcomes when humans are not in the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. These advancements in traditional AI tools are expected to "infinitely more powerful" crypto agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

## Real-world Applications and Adoption

The [[intersection_of_ai_and_crypto | intersection of AI and crypto]] is leading to innovative real-world applications beyond decentralized finance (DeFi).

### Sports Betting [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI Agents]]
Sports betting and prediction markets are a growing area for [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.
*   **Tracy AI**: This sports forecasting agent focuses on basketball (NBA), providing commentary and analysis rather than direct betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. It gained mainstream attention through endorsements from NBA players and even Khlo√© Kardashian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. Tracy AI is a visual, real-time interactive AI commentator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   **Ask Billy**: Another agent from the Virtuals ecosystem, Ask Billy, is designed for betting on PolyMarket, a decentralized prediction market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This agent leverages a competitive strategy mechanism via BitTensor, an AI L1 protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. In its test phase, Ask Billy turned $50 into $650 in three weeks and is now managing a $100,000 portfolio on PolyMarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This demonstrates AI agents' potential to improve the efficiency and liquidity of long-tail prediction markets by automating low-profit but high-volume transactions that humans wouldn't pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

### Kaido as a Data Layer
Kaido, a platform for measuring investor attention and sentiment in crypto, is launching its Kaito token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. Kaido aims to be the "data layer for the attention economy" or "Google for crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. It uses AI algorithms to curate high-quality information from various sources (Twitter, Farcaster, governance forums, podcast transcripts), filtering out "low signal" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. Kaido's APIs are already used by builders to feed high-quality data to their AI agents, which is crucial for agent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. The Kaito token is expected to incentivize a decentralized network for sourcing and validating data, potentially rewarding high-value content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>.

## BitTensor's Role in the Global AI Stack
BitTensor (TAO) is a key protocol in the [[integration_of_ai_with_traditional_and_web3_tools | integration of AI with Web3 tools]], functioning as an AI Layer 1 (L1) blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. It coordinates various AI activities on its network, including providing compute models, agent applications, and training models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

### Dynamic Tao Upgrade
BitTensor recently implemented a major upgrade called "Dynamic Tao," which gives each AI application (dapp) spun up on the network its own token (subnet token or Alpha token) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. These subnet tokens are paired with the underlying TAO token, creating a similar structure to Virtuals, where every agent token is paired with Virtuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. This upgrade significantly improves the distribution of TAO rewards, directing incentives to actual teams building useful AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>. BitTensor aims to fund the open-source AI movement by providing substantial incentives (e.g., $1.2 billion annually) for teams to build foundational AI resources, such as compute and model access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. Projects like Kaido and News Research have utilized BitTensor subnets for their open-source development and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Crypto AI Projects

Projects like AI16z (now rebranded as Eliza OS) are refining their approach to build more structured and impactful [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI agents]].

### AI16z (Eliza OS) Roadmap
Eliza OS has undergone significant restructuring, moving from a more open-source, flat "hippie free love" structure to a focused product pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. Their roadmap focuses on three core principles:
1.  **Autonomous and Adaptable Agents**: Agents that operate without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.
2.  **Modular Architecture**: Building components that are easier to scale and iterate, preventing catastrophic failures if one component has a bug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.
3.  **Decentralization**: Developing these systems in a decentralized format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>.

A highlight of their roadmap is an "agent-powered social trading layer," which will enable groups of people to spin up agents that execute trades based on calls made in chat messengers (Telegram, Discord) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>. These agents would learn autonomously from the group's trade data, earning a "reputation or trust score" based on their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. This combines crypto's "social mode" with autonomous agent trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

Additionally, Eliza OS plans an "Agent Marketplace" to serve as an official agent launchpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. This marketplace aims for multi-agent interaction and value exchange, allowing agents to trade or leverage each other's services like a platform layer for microservices (an "App Store") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. It will also feature a custom-built liquidity pool (LP) design to prevent "sniping" and partner with high-quality teams to launch agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. The shift to a more curated approach is expected to lead to higher quality agents being built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.# The [[intersection_of_ai_and_crypto_technology | Integration of Crypto AI with Traditional AI Sectors]]

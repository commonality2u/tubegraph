From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The [[development of stablecoins | development of stablecoins]] for payment purposes is still in its early stages, estimated to be only about 5% complete in terms of figuring out how to build a truly valuable stablecoin for this use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Market Size and Current Penetration

The global cross-border payments market is substantial, accounting for approximately $200 trillion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In contrast, the current volume of cross-border transactions conducted using stablecoins is around $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. A significant portion of this market, particularly the Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) segment, which represents about 40% of the total, is expected to be better served by stablecoins and stablecoin rails in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Advantages of Stablecoins for Cross-Border Payments

For specific use cases like cross-border payments, stablecoins are considered "functionally and unequivocally better" than traditional methods, provided certain [[infrastructure required for stablecoin payments | infrastructure problems]] are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Challenges and Infrastructure Needs

Despite their potential, several [[infrastructure challenges in stablecoins | infrastructure challenges]] need to be addressed for stablecoins to fully realize their benefits in cross-border payments:
*   **Compliance Concerns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   **Liquidity** Ensuring sufficient liquidity to facilitate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   **Cost Reduction** Driving down transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   **Last-Mile Solutions** Developing solutions for the final stage of payment delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

## Comparison with Traditional Payment Services

Traditional services like Wise, which target a significant revenue stream estimated at $50 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, face inherent inefficiencies that stablecoins could overcome. Wise, for example, is described as a great business but is "capital inefficient" and requires extensive interconnectivity and operational ties with the traditional banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These requirements would be unnecessary if transactions were conducted on stablecoin rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The [[impact of stablecoins on traditional banks | emergence of stablecoin solutions]] could lead to existing services either adopting stablecoin technology or being displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

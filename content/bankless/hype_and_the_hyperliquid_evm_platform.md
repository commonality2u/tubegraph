The HyperLiquid platform is notable for its "enshrined application setup" that generates significant fees, routinely placing it at the top of chain fees [00:50:34]. Its core functionality centers around perpetuals (PERPs) trading, with the PERPs exchange being described as a "great" and "really good" exchange for users [00:57:08].

## The HyperLiquid EVM

Beyond its core PERPs platform, HyperLiquid has launched an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) side, intended as a "general programmable sidecar" [00:50:52]. This EVM is designed to offer programmability and some integration with the PERPs platform.

### Integration and Functionality
The HyperLiquid EVM aims to synergize with the main PERPs platform through "enshrined op codes" [00:52:54]. These codes allow applications built on the EVM to access data from the HyperLiquid exchange [00:52:59]. Theoretically, this could enable EVM applications to utilize the deep liquidity and rich trading data of the PERPs platform, for example, for oracles or advanced trading strategies [00:53:17]. The long-term vision includes enabling buying and selling on the exchange directly through the EVM, though this functionality is not yet live [00:53:08].

The platform also features a "dual block architecture" [00:53:36]. This system uses:
*   Smaller, cheaper, and faster blocks for regular transactions (currently around 2 million gas, which can be easily filled) [00:53:54].
*   Bigger, more expensive blocks for deploying smart contracts and executing complex batching operations [00:53:46].

### Performance and Challenges
Despite its innovative approach, the HyperLiquid EVM has faced challenges:
*   **Performance:** The EVM is "not actually performant at all" [00:55:31], with its throughput being roughly "1/30th of Base" [00:55:40]. This can lead to a "quicksand" user experience, which is "not a great move" for a general-purpose EVM chain [00:55:58].
*   **User Adoption:** Users who own Hype (the asset) tend to value it as a holding rather than using it as gas or for other transactions on the EVM [00:51:32]. Furthermore, the user experience on the Hyper EVM is not comparable to the main PERPs exchange, and there isn't "much to do" on the EVM side currently [00:52:00].
*   **Differentiation:** Launching another EVM chain is inherently difficult, particularly when the most obvious and flagship applications (perpetual and spot exchanges) are already integral to the core platform [00:56:45]. This leaves the EVM to attract users to "other like stuff that people already care about a little bit less" [00:56:56].

### Future Outlook
Despite these challenges, there's an expectation that the HyperLiquid EVM could see growth, driven by "one or two catalysts" [00:52:12]. A significant factor is the platform's "massive war chest of hype" that can be used for airdrops and incentives [00:57:28]. The success of other incentive-driven platforms, like Uni Chain, suggests that such mechanisms can effectively attract users and funds [00:57:35]. The recent appearance of a new points page on the HyperLiquid UI indicates a potential "aggressive incentive mechanism" for the Hyper EVM, which could be a "pretty big ball mover" for adoption [00:57:43].

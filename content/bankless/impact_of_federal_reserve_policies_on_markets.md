The Federal Reserve's recent signals regarding interest rates have sparked notable reactions across financial markets and political spheres.

## Federal Reserve's Stance and Inflation Outlook

The Federal Reserve has indicated no further interest rate cuts in 2025, primarily due to higher-than-expected inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Inflation increased by 0.5% month-over-month and reached 3% year-over-year, slightly exceeding the forecast of 2.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

During his testimony before Congress, Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the Fed is in no rush to cut interest rates, citing a strong economy and elevated inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Political Reaction to Fed Policy

Donald Trump expressed dissatisfaction with the Fed's stance, tweeting on Truth Social that "interest rates should be lowered something which should go hand in hand with upcoming tariffs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This echoes a similar situation during the previous Trump Administration eight years prior, where Trump sought to influence Powell to adopt a more "easy monetary policy environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Tun Chetra from Gauntlet noted that many of Trump's proposed policies, such as tariffs, are generally pro-inflationary, meaning his [[trumps_economic_policies_and_their_impact_on_the_us_economy | economic policies]] rely on low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Market Responses

The markets reacted negatively to the Fed's signals:
*   The S&P 500 declined by a quarter of a percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Treasury yields jumped, contrary to Trump's stated desire for them to go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Bitcoin and [[impact_of_monetary_policy_on_cryptocurrencies | crypto markets]] also dipped, with Bitcoin falling below $59,000 when markets opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

Commenting on the broader [[impact_on_american_markets | impact on American markets]], Tun Chetra suggested that the market's "overheating" post-election might calm down, leading to a relaxation in prices as the initial exuberance wanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. He characterized crypto markets as acting like a "prediction market on the weekends for what the Nasdaq is going to do on Monday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

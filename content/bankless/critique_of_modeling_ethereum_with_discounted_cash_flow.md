The valuation of Ethereum (ETH) as an asset is a complex and frequently debated topic within the cryptocurrency community. Sam Kasmanian, CEO and co-founder of Frax, argues that the prevailing method of valuing ETH based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is detrimental and should be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. He advocates for [[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | positioning ETH]] primarily as a commodity money and store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

## Two Ways to Value an Asset

According to Kasmanian, there are two primary ways to value an asset from a first-principles perspective:
1.  **Fundamentals View (Discounted Cash Flow)**: In this view, an asset represents a claim on some kind of future cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. This approach treats the asset as equity-like, where its value is derived from the income it generates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
2.  **Commodity View**: This perspective sees an asset as something that does not represent a claim on future cash flows. Its value is driven by demand, whether for industrial use cases or as a store of value. Gold is a prime example, valued for its industrial utility (e.g., in circuit boards) and its [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | role as a store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Sam Kasmanian's Core Thesis on ETH

Kasmanian contends that the Ethereum community has erred by increasingly defining ETH as a DCF asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. He believes that conversations around ETH should exclusively focus on its [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | role as a store of value commodity money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. This focus on DCF models, he argues, has contributed to ETH's underperformance relative to Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a> and will continue to depress its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

### Separation of ETH Technology and ETH Asset
A crucial aspect of Kasmanian's argument is the clear distinction between the Ethereum *technology* and the Ether *asset* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>. While the Ethereum blockchain, its roadmap, and its ethos are highly valued for enabling decentralized computation and DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>, the success of the technology does not automatically guarantee the appreciation of the ETH asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This disconnect leads to internal conflicts within the community regarding L2s and fee structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### The Impact of EIP-1559 and Proof of Stake
The transition to Proof of Stake and the implementation of EIP-1559 (which burns a portion of transaction fees) fundamentally altered the perception of ETH the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. These changes, though technologically sound, inadvertently shifted the predominant definition of ETH towards a DCF model, emphasizing the cash flows generated by transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>. Kasmanian believes that while these technical changes were not mistakes, the *social interpretation* of them was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>.

### The "Floor Price" Problem
By focusing on ETH's cash flows (via EIP-1559 burns), the community is inadvertently coordinating around the asset's *minimum* or *floor* valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This is analogous to only valuing gold based on its industrial use in circuit boards, ignoring its primary [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | role as a store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. If ETH continues to be valued primarily by its expected discounted cash flows, Kasmanian predicts a potential valuation of $500-$600, despite the technology's continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

## The Socially Constructed Nature of Asset Definition

Kasmanian emphasizes that an asset's definition is not merely marketing; it is a "socially constructed fundamental definition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. If a critical mass of people, from ETF issuers to developers, agrees on a certain definition (e.g., DCF model), that definition causally shapes what the asset *is* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. A lack of unified social consensus on ETH's identity leads to chaos and prevents a clear value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### [[comparison_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_asset_narratives | Comparison between Bitcoin and Ethereum's Asset Narratives]]
Bitcoin's design, particularly its fixed supply and proof-of-work mechanism, inherently prevents a DCF-based valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>. This "superpower" forces the community to coherently talk about BTC as a digital commodity and store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Kasmanian hypothesizes that even if Bitcoin integrated a fee-burning mechanism like EIP-1559, its deeply ingrained social definition as a store of value would likely prevent a shift to a DCF narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Ethereum, on the other hand, made it possible to talk about discounted cash flows, and the community embraced it, leading to the current challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## Addressing the Tension: Technology vs. Asset Identity

The challenge for Ethereum is balancing its strong technological product with a clear asset narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Ethereum will always generate revenue at Layer 1 due to EIP-1559 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. The problem is not the existence of revenue, but the *emphasis* placed on it for valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

Ryan Sean Adams's "Blue Money Gospel" proposes a "cult-like" or "religion-like" approach to fostering a zealous community around ETH as an asset, similar to Bitcoin's maximalist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Kasmanian agrees with this direction, highlighting that such social coordination is essential for defining the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

This leads to the concept of [[convexity_in_ethereum_technology_and_concavity_in_ether_asset_approach | convexity in Ethereum technology and concavity in Ether asset approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.
*   **Technology (Convexity)**: Ethereum's technology should maintain a "big tent mentality"—being adaptable, flexible, open, and pragmatic for application builders and Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
*   **Asset (Concavity)**: ETH as an asset, however, needs a maximalist, strong, and even "unforgiving" approach, particularly when communicating to entities like Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

The difficulty lies in navigating both lanes simultaneously: being pragmatic about the product while being maximalist about the asset's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

Kasmanian remains [[future_price_predictions_and_expectations_for_ethereum | bullish on ETH's price]] in USD terms, envisioning future valuations like $80K, but stresses that this depends on addressing the asset's current identity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. He fears a future where ETH reaches $20K based on DCF, while BTC climbs to $2 million, marking a new all-time low for ETH against BTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>.

To shift the narrative, Ethereum needs:
*   A social commitment to never change the emission algorithm, making the asset's supply dynamics easier to reason about, similar to Bitcoin's predictable halving schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   A collective effort to avoid predominantly discussing the asset's value based on its industrial use case (fee burns), which only defines its floor price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

If the Ethereum community can untangle the asset from the technology and establish a clear, unified social definition of ETH as a commodity money and store of value, then all downstream issues—like the "parasitic" debate about L2s—will resolve themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Without this clear definition, the community risks remaining in a state of "chaos," preventing effective coordination and value accrual to the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

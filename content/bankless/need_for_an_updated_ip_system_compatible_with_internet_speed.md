The current intellectual property (IP) system, particularly copyright, is significantly outdated and struggles to keep pace with modern content generation on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system dates back to the printing press era and was well-suited for top-down distribution channels like books, radio, and television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. In those environments, distribution was controlled, allowing for the enforcement of royalties, such as labels working with radio stations or transmitting films via TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Challenges Posed by the Internet

The advent of the [[impact_of_the_internet_on_copyright_distribution | internet]] dramatically shifted content distribution to a peer-to-peer model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This led to an explosion in content creators and content being remixed and shared at immense speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Exponential Growth with AI

The problem has been compounded exponentially by artificial intelligence (AI), with petabytes and pabytes of content being generated daily, if not hourly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This rapid content creation and dissemination highlight a critical juncture where the [[current_limitations_of_the_copyright_system | current copyright system]] is incapable of supporting the present reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Requirements for a New IP System

To address these challenges, there is a clear need for a new IP system that is compatible with the speed of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This modern system must be:

*   **Programmable**: Any IP created should be instantly registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Seamless for Derivatives**: New content derived from existing content must be seamlessly licensed and fairly attributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The Ethereum ecosystem, particularly the Ethereum Foundation (EF), has recently faced scrutiny and undergone significant internal reorientation to address perceived problems and adapt to a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>. This shift includes a move towards a more product-focused mindset and a re-evaluation of its role within the decentralized network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>.

## Identifying the Problem

For almost three years, the ETH price has lagged the market, and signals of underlying issues within Ethereum have grown stronger as other ecosystems have captured marginal industry growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. In 2025, the debate is no longer *if* there's a problem, but its exact nature and what to do about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

Common criticisms or perceived problems include:
*   **Marketing Problem**: Some suggest other ecosystems "shill shill shill" and get the word out more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **Product Problem / Northstar Problem**: A lack of clarity on what Ethereum is building towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Activity on Ethereum is down, with less app building and fewer users, making it no longer the obvious default platform for building in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Leadership Problem**: Discordant voices and a perceived lack of clear direction within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

At its root, the problem has been attributed to the EF and Ethereum operating as an "ivory tower," focused on high-brow research without actively listening to app builders and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This has resulted in not treating Ethereum as a product that should serve its users, instead focusing on what users *should* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Historical Role of the Ethereum Foundation

Historically, the [[role_and_responsibilities_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] saw its role primarily as a public goods funder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>. It operated as a collection of independent projects, distributing money without unified strategic oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. Decisions were often made in small groups, sometimes involving as few as four people, including Vitalik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:55">[02:20:55]</a>. This decentralized, defensive approach was seen as necessary in earlier times, when more centralized appearances would have been problematic for the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:44">[02:37:44]</a>.

The initial strategy made sense given the nascent state of blockchain technology. Around 2013-2015, there was limited knowledge about scaling blockchains, making research highly valuable. This research disproportionately benefited Ethereum, helping it dominate the smart contract platform space from 2015 to roughly 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Shifting Landscape and Self-Inflicted Challenges

Around 2021, the meta shifted from prioritizing research to investing in product, as blockchain technology became more understood and congestion limits were hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Ethereum's historical culture and environment, once an advantage, became a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. While the rollup-centric roadmap was technically sound for the long-term, it neglected the short-to-medium term needs of the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>.

This led to what some describe as "self-inflicted" issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Ethereum "rejected the growth" by not prioritizing L1 development, expecting users to go to Layer 2s, which often feel like separate chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The lack of seamless interoperability and consistent product branding between L1 and L2s meant that L2 growth (e.g., Base) was not perceived as Ethereum growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

Furthermore, competitors like Solana have demonstrated strong product execution, putting pressure on Ethereum to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:11">[02:07:11]</a>. The realization that real-world adoption requires readiness now, not in five years, has driven a sense of urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## New Leadership and Strategic Reorientation

A significant [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_transition | leadership transition]] has occurred within the EF. The long-standing executive director, Aya Miyaguchi, moved to President, and Tomas and Shiao were appointed as co-CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This represents a shift in the EF's ambition from a public goods funder to a more "CEO-style role" that unifies individual projects and teams into a cohesive shared product view and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>. Tomas is expected to focus on building new capabilities related to product and strategy, while Shiao may focus on historical responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>.

This [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_changes | change in leadership]] is accompanied by a new [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_and_community_dynamics | attitude]] of openness and a product mindset, previously non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. There is a strong consensus on the urgency and short-to-medium term actions needed to restore Ethereum's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

### Emphasis on Layer 1 Growth

A key new focus is scaling the L1, reversing the past mistake of making L1 use expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. The goal is to encourage activity on L1, recognizing it as the economic center of Ethereum, with continued space for DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This means abandoning ideological opposition to L1 scaling and instead defining node types and using technical means to maximize L1 scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Evolving Role of Layer 2s

The rollup-centric roadmap is still considered the correct long-term strategy for scaling Ethereum to billions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. However, the understanding of L2s is evolving:
*   **Transparent Spillover Space**: L2s can serve as generic, transparent spillover space from L1, essential as L1 cannot immediately handle all demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The focus is on seamless interoperability and standards for assets flowing between L1 and L2s, aiming for a future where users don't distinguish between L1 and L2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Special Purpose L2s**: There's also room for differentiated L2s for specific applications, like gaming, which may always feel distinct from L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Sticking Rollups to Ethereum**: Ethereum aims to offer services (like sequencing and data availability) that make L2s "sticky" and more integrated, reducing their switching costs to other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. This includes "based rollups" and "native rollups" which integrate more deeply with Ethereum's L1 security model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. The goal is a mutually beneficial outcome where L2s get interop benefits and the Ethereum brand, while Ethereum gets tightly coupled L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Scaling the L1: Capacity and Block Times

The plan for L1 scaling involves a phased approach:
1.  **Immediate Push**: Without technical changes, leveraging existing headroom. This year, the gas limit increased from 30 million to 36 million, with expectations to reach 72 million by fall and potentially 100 million by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.
2.  **Feature-Based Scaling**: The next hard fork, Glamsterdam (first half of next year), will introduce features like delayed execution and access list parallelization, enabling a gas limit of 300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.
3.  **ZK-based Scaling**: In two to three years, a ZK-based approach will allow for aggressive scaling while maintaining lightweight verification nodes, by putting L1 execution into blobs, effectively making the L1 itself function like a rollup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>.

Regarding block times, while some fancy tricks can give the *perception* of instant latency, there's a valid conversation about actually reducing block times for DeFi benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Current thinking aims to reduce slot times to around 6 seconds, and potentially even 1 second in the very long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. Work is also progressing on pre-confirmations, aiming to make them a core part of the Ethereum stack to provide optimistic guarantees for near-instant user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.

## Cultural and Structural Shifts

The [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_and_community_dynamics | Ethereum Foundation]] is actively undergoing a change in [[ethereums_leadership_and_community_dynamics | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>. Tomas's approach has opened internal communication channels, fostering a more listening and less "ivory tower" stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:31">[02:29:31]</a>. The EF is extending its responsibilities to include holistic guidance on product experience and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:21">[02:20:21]</a>. There's a clear shift towards prioritizing shorter timeframes and focusing on engineering execution alongside research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The organization is bringing in new voices, such as Josh Rudolph, who leads product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Outlook and Future Direction

Despite being slow to adapt due to its decentralized nature, there's strong consensus within Ethereum about the urgency of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. The "Ethereum ship" is turning around, with meaningful progress on multiple fronts, including adopting a product mindset, scaling L1, and making leadership changes at the EF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. The deep technical long-term upgrades that have been developed are now expected to bear fruit in the medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

While execution is key and still needs to be proven, the clarity of direction provides optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>. Ethereum retains core strengths that differentiate it from other ecosystems, and by addressing its weaknesses, it aims to maintain a strong position in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. The changes are expected to become apparent on a three-month, not three-year, timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

Ethereum, the largest decentralized ecosystem, has faced significant challenges in recent years, leading to a re-evaluation of its strategic direction. While the network remains strong and healthy, issues such as a lagging ETH price and declining activity have prompted a shift towards a more product-centric and growth-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Defining the Problem

The core issue facing Ethereum has been identified as a decline in activity, app building, and user growth on its Layer 1 (L1) network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This has resulted in the ETH price lagging the market for nearly three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Marginal growth in the industry has been captured by other Layer 1 ecosystems like Solana, rather than by Ethereum or its Layer 2 (L2) networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

Several factors contributed to this situation:
*   **Ivory Tower Mentality**: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) and researchers were seen as an "ivory tower," focusing on high-level research rather than actively listening to the needs of app builders and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Neglect of Layer 1**: Despite a "rollup-centric roadmap" being the correct long-term strategy, the Ethereum Layer 1 was neglected for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, with essentially no scaling for five years until a recent 20% bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   **Perception of L2s**: Growth on L2s like Base was not widely perceived as "Ethereum growth" because L2s felt like separate chains due to interoperability challenges and distinct branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Cultural Focus**: Ethereum's culture historically prioritized deeply technical, long-term upgrades over short and medium-term solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This was partly due to the early era of blockchain development where fundamental research was paramount (2014-2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, but the meta shifted around 2021 to a need for product focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Decentralization Challenges**: The decentralized nature of Ethereum led to a lack of clear responsibility for guiding the entire ecosystem as a cohesive product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Solutions and Strategic Shifts

The Ethereum community is now undergoing a significant reorientation, focusing on short to medium-term actions to restore growth and a product mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>.

### Prioritizing Layer 1 Scaling

A major shift is the renewed focus on scaling the Ethereum Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. The goal is to make the L1 an economic center and a default platform for app building again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

The planned scaling approach involves three stages:
1.  **Immediate Headroom Utilization**: Increase the gas limit without major technical changes. It recently went from 30 million to 36 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>, with plans to reach approximately 72 million by Fall and 100 million by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.
2.  **Feature-Based Scaling**: In upcoming hard forks like Glamsterdam (first half of next year), features such as delayed execution and access list parallelization will be introduced to further increase scalability without significantly increasing the direct network load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. This is expected to enable a gas limit of 300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.
3.  **ZK-Based Scaling**: Within two to three years, ZK-based solutions will allow for massive scaling. This involves using ZK proofs to verify the L1, effectively making the L1 itself technically a rollup in terms of verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. This will enable lightweight verification nodes, allowing for aggressive scaling (potentially 100x or 1000x) without compromising core properties like verifiability and censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.

There is now broad consensus for a 10x scale increase on L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>, overcoming previous ideological opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

### Layer 2 Strategy and Integration

The rollup-centric roadmap is affirmed as the correct long-term architecture, but it requires a very strong Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. L2s are seen as essential for providing transparent, generic spillover space from the L1, particularly as L1 growth cannot meet all demand immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

Key aspects for L2s include:
*   **Seamless Interoperability**: Establishing standards for assets flowing between L1 and L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.
*   **User Experience**: The long-term vision is for users to not even notice if they are on L1 or L2, viewing it as one large, infinite compute space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.
*   **Product Differentiation**: Ethereum L1 aims to offer valuable services to L2s to make them "sticky," such as providing blobs for data availability, R&D, and developer resources to enhance compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Native and Based Rollups**: These models, which eliminate certain security slices (e.g., sequencer for Base Rollups), are seen as being "much closer to truly being Ethereum" compared to existing L2s with higher degrees of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. The goal is a symbiotic relationship where L2s benefit from interoperability and the Ethereum brand, and L1 benefits from tightly coupled L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

### Improving Block Times and Latency

While increasing block size is a priority, reducing block times is also crucial for DeFi's product features (lower MEV, tighter spreads for market makers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.

Current efforts focus on three areas:
1.  **Optimistic Pre-confirmations**: Providing immediate, crypto-economically backed promises of transaction inclusion for better user experience, similar to how sequencers offer guarantees on L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. This is being explored to become a core part of the Ethereum stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.
2.  **Finality**: Speeding up the time to block finality, which is crucial for L2 interactions and exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.
3.  **Censorship Resistance**: Reducing the time until a transaction can be included by someone other than the current block proposer, thereby ending the monopoly lock on a slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.

Reducing slot times to potentially 6 seconds is considered feasible in the medium term, with even 1-second blocks being a long-term aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. This would be achieved without compromising Ethereum's core value of allowing anyone on Earth to run a node and audit transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

### Ethereum Foundation's Transformation

The Ethereum Foundation is undergoing significant internal changes to align with these new priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. Historically, the EF operated more as a public goods funding organization, with decentralized projects and limited internal coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>.

Under new co-CEOs Tomas and Shiao, the EF is shifting towards a more unified, product-centric approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>. This includes:
*   **Increased Communication**: Opening channels for broader discussion on strategy, moving away from small, exclusive groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:02">[02:10:02]</a>.
*   **Product Mindset**: Cultivating a culture where internal teams feel responsible for the overall product view and shared strategy of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>.
*   **New Leadership Roles**: The executive director role is evolving into a CEO-style function, unifying projects and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Tomas is focused on building new capabilities, while Shiao maintains historical responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Execution**: There is a clear understanding that Ethereum's success now depends on execution, not just default leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>. This shift is bringing in new voices and expertise, such as product managers, to better understand and address user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>.

While the "ship is slowly turning itself around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>, the mindset shift is more advanced than the actual path change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. Nevertheless, there's a strong consensus on the urgency and the correct directional course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a>.

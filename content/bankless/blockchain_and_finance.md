The current global financial system, despite its reliance on the internet, does not truly embody "internet finance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, it consists of finance housed in siloed databases that communicate over the internet only occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The burgeoning [[modernization_of_financial_markets_with_blockchain | internet financial system]] is characterized by significantly more innovation and experimentation compared to the legacy financial system over the past three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This new system, encompassing crypto, blockchain, and DeFi, represents a paradigm shift in global financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Distinguishing True Internet Finance

Felipe Montilgre, co-founder of Thea Capital, champions the term "internet financial system" to better express this frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This term is preferred over "DeFi" (decentralized finance), which limits the scope, or "blockchain" and "crypto," which are often overloaded with other ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The internet financial system aims for lower-cost financial services globally, facilitating better capital flow across borders, and providing efficient, low-fee financial access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Limitations of [[pre_blockchain_internet_finance | Pre-Blockchain Internet Finance]]

The notion that we already have internet finance because one can access a bank account online is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This is akin to ordering pizza online: the internet acts merely as a communication mechanism, not as the underlying infrastructure where the actual value or asset exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. In the legacy system, transactions occur in permissioned, siloed databases not on the open internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

For instance, owning Apple stock on Robinhood means one's ownership is recorded in Robinhood's internal database; Apple does not directly know the individual shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Similarly, land ownership in less advanced countries might be recorded on physical rolls or in local offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This "patchwork of siloed servers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>, communicating occasionally over the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, leads to significant friction.

## Inefficiencies of the Legacy Financial System

The current financial topology, characterized by a mesh network of loosely cohered siloed servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, creates substantial friction and constrains growth and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>:

*   **High Transaction Costs:** Transferring assets between different systems, like moving Apple stock from Robinhood to Fidelity, requires complex communication and approvals between intermediaries, resulting in high costs and paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. International money transfers also involve a slow, multi-step process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   **High Barriers to Entry:** Because servers are permissioned, new entrants cannot easily update or interact with existing financial ledgers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. The number of new FDIC-insured commercial banks, for example, dropped to near zero after 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. This stifles innovation, as demonstrated by the delayed adoption of Eric Budish's batch auction solution in traditional exchanges due to vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
*   **Local Banking Oligopolies:** Banking systems in many countries are dominated by a few large institutions due to economies of scale and local gatekeeper access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. In emerging markets, the five largest banks often control over 50% of the market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. These oligopolies tend to "underprovision and overprice" loans, leading to high Net Interest Margins (NIMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

### The Impact of High Net Interest Margins (NIMs)

Net Interest Margin (NIM) is the spread between what banks borrow at and what they lend at, serving as a proxy for their pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Less developed financial systems exhibit much higher NIMs, typically 5 to 10 percentage points higher than developed systems, and sometimes as high as 20 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

This significantly impedes economic growth:
*   Higher mortgage rates mean fewer houses sold and built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   More expensive small and medium business loans hinder new business formation and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   Higher auto loan rates might prevent individuals from taking better job opportunities further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

This "local banking problem" is a pernicious barrier to GDP, employment, and overall development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. The capital layer is the fundamental input for an economy, and high costs at this layer reverberate throughout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.

## The Promise of Servers with Laws

The internet financial system leverages "servers with laws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>, which are scalable servers (blockchains) that interact with their own predefined laws and smart contract code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. The ability to put assets into a contract that executes logic like a vending machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a> unlocks immense efficiencies and design space for new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

*   **Credible Commitments:** The core innovation is "credible commitments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Unlike traditional systems where trust is placed in parties, blockchain technology provides verifiable guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. Satoshi's solution to the double-spend problem paved the way for permissionless servers with intrinsic laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
    *   Bitcoin was the first credible commitment server, guaranteeing its 21 million supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
    *   [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_ethereum_in_global_finance | Ethereum]] extended this, allowing for open-ended credible commitments on any software-defined logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.
*   **Unified, Transparent Ledgers:** Instead of millions of siloed servers, blockchains represent single, unified servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. These public ledgers allow anyone with root access to view asset records, eliminating the need for cumbersome communication between disparate databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This unlocks financial efficiency, access, and strong property rights globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## The Civilizational Impact

The internet financial system is considered a significant step forward for civilization, comparable to Gutenberg's printing press in its impact on knowledge dissemination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

*   **Global Capital Flows:** It facilitates true global capital flows, allowing capital to seek high-return opportunities across borders without being hindered by intermediaries and high transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Property Rights:** A major benefit is the ability to establish stronger property rights, especially in countries with weak rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Many nations have abysmal property rights scores (average 43 on a 100-point scale), leading to trillions in "dead capital" that cannot be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
    *   Digital assets like Bitcoin provide real, strong property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
    *   The tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), such as US stocks or land registries on-chain as NFTs, can extend robust property rights to billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.
    *   This has profound implications for saving rates, transforming -65% currency deflation relative to USD to +10% US stock market appreciation over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Interaction with Nation-States:** While blockchain laws are stronger than many nation-state laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, they must coexist. Governments will adapt and layer legal systems on top of these technologies, just as they did with cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. The US administration's embrace of crypto, particularly stablecoins and RWA tokenization, is seen as crucial for widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Looking Forward

Despite the lofty goals, the industry has faced challenges, including speculative booms, fraud (e.g., FTX), and a perception of "grift and extraction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>.

*   **Technological Maturity:** The underlying technology was not fully scalable five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>. However, significant improvements in transaction costs (e.g., Uniswap trades dropping from 80 basis points to single digits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>, [[discussion_on_blockchain_scalability_and_data_throughput | blockchain scalability]], and user experience (UX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a> mean the technology is now ready for widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
*   **Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) DNA:** The era of zero interest rates fostered a speculative environment, leading to misallocation of capital and a "greater fool paradigm" in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. Higher interest rates are seen as a necessary "purge" to shift the industry's focus back to building real, useful products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.
*   **Underserved Markets:** Innovation often begins in underserved markets. Initially, blockchain attracted speculators and unsavory characters due to its less mature UX and regulatory ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. As UX improves and regulatory barriers fall, the proportion of such users will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.

## Investing in the Internet Financial System

The principles of [[valuation_models_for_blockchain_networks | investing in blockchain networks]] adhere to fundamental financial analysis. The core principle of discounted cash flow (DCF), which predicts future cash flows from a business to determine its value, applies to crypto markets just as it does to traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>.

*   **Fundamentals vs. Greater Fool:** The distinction between investing based on fundamentals (future cash flows) and the "greater fool paradigm" (buying because someone else might pay more) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>. While Bitcoin and Ethereum might be exceptions due to their unique properties, most assets do not fall under this exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>.
*   **Protocols as Businesses:** The early idea of "inert protocols" that are immutable and self-sufficient has largely failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:59">[01:21:59]</a>. Protocols that are successful today are actively managed businesses, continuously innovating, expanding, and adapting to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>. Investors in these protocols expect continuous innovation and new products to accrue value to the original token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48">[01:27:48]</a>.
*   **Token Holder Protection:** The market is increasingly demanding "token holder protections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a>. Concepts like "future key" allow conditional markets to price governance decisions, potentially preventing "DAO looting" or unwanted changes by disincentivizing actions that would devalue the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>. This provides a mechanism for token holders to enforce their interests through smart contract code, much like shareholder protections in traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:39">[01:32:39]</a>.

This evolving landscape marks a new era of maturity for crypto, shifting from speculation to building valuable products and fostering stronger cooperation between technology and regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:18">[01:30:18]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Ethereum, the largest decentralized ecosystem, is currently undergoing significant self-reflection and reorientation to address perceived problems and restore growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This includes a shift in priorities, changes within the Ethereum Foundation (EF), and a renewed focus on the user experience and market competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Defining the Problem
The core issue facing Ethereum is a decline in activity, app building, and user growth, leading to a perception that it is no longer the obvious default platform for crypto development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. While the lagging ETH price is a concern, it's considered a symptom rather than the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Key problems identified include:
*   **Lack of Growth on Layer 1 (L1):** The primary issue is a lack of growth specifically on the Ethereum L1, which has led to a decreasing ETH price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This is seen as "self-inflicted" because Ethereum "rejected the growth" by prioritizing long-term scaling solutions (L2s) without adequately considering immediate L1 needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **"Ivory Tower" Mentality:** The Ethereum Foundation (EF) and researchers have historically been seen as an "ivory tower," focusing on "very high brow research" and long-term technical solutions (e.g., 10-20 year plans) without sufficiently listening to app builders and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This led to not treating Ethereum as a product to serve its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Lack of Product Focus:** Historically, Ethereum's development lacked a strong product mindset, focusing more on technical challenges and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Decentralization's Downstream Consequences:** While decentralization is a core value, it led to a lack of clear responsibility for the overall product experience and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Small groups often made critical decisions without broader input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.
*   **Competitive Landscape Shift:** Until recently, Ethereum lacked strong competitors in product execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. The rise of other ecosystems like Solana, which excels at product, has put pressure on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

## Role of the Ethereum Foundation
The Ethereum Foundation (EF) previously acted more as a public goods funding organization, distributing money to independent projects without taking on the role of overall leader or strategist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This approach was considered necessary for decentralization in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

However, there is now a significant [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | change happening at the EF]], with a shift towards taking more responsibility for guiding Ethereum holistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. This includes focusing on:
*   **Product Experience:** Ensuring the entire Ethereum ecosystem functions as a cohesive product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Developing a clear and unified strategy for Ethereum's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **New Leadership:** With the appointment of Tomas and Shiao as co-CEOs, the executive director role has evolved to a more "CEO style role" focused on unifying individual projects and teams into a shared product view and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>.
*   **Open Communication:** A significant change is increased internal and external communication, with new leadership actively listening to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>.

## Roadmap and Scaling
The "rollup-centric roadmap" is reaffirmed as the correct long-term strategy, but with a renewed emphasis on strengthening the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.

### L1 Scaling Initiatives
Scaling the L1 is now a major focus, driven by the realization that Ethereum needs to be ready *now* for real-world adoption, not in 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. The goal is to avoid past mistakes of L1 becoming too expensive to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

The [[challenges_and_solutions_in_ethereum_scaling | Ethereum L1 scaling]] plan involves three stages:
1.  **Immediate Push (This Year):** Scaling the L1 without any technological changes, simply by utilizing available headroom and being less conservative. This includes increasing the gas limit from 36 million to potentially 72 million (by Fall) and then 100 million by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>.
2.  **Feature-Based Scaling (Next Year - Glamsterdam Hard Fork):** The next open hard fork, Glamsterdam (first half of next year), will introduce features like delayed execution, block-level access lists, and EIP-4444 gas pricing changes to further scale without directly increasing network load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. These are expected to enable a gas limit of 300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.
3.  **ZK-Based Scaling (2-3 Years Out):** This "big step" involves using ZK-proving systems for the L1, turning it technically into a rollup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. This will allow for aggressive scaling while maintaining lightweight verification for nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>. The main challenge is ensuring the reliability and safety of this complex technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.

The ideological opposition to scaling the L1 has largely diminished, with near full acceptance for at least a 10x increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.

### L2s and Interoperability
L2s are essential for Ethereum's scaling, as the L1 cannot handle all demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. The benefits of L2s are seen in two main types:
1.  **Generic Spillover Space:** These L2s provide transparent, generic capacity to handle demand not met by the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. The goal is seamless interoperability, with assets flowing easily and users not even noticing if they are on L1 or L2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. This includes [[coordination_and_governance_in_ethereums_rollup_roadmap | native interoperability solutions]] offered directly by the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.
2.  **Special Purpose L2s:** Differentiated L2s with specific roles for applications like gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. Their relationship with the L1 will likely remain more distinct, primarily relying on L1 for data availability (DA) and settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

A key challenge is the perception that L2 growth (e.g., Base) is not the same as Ethereum growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This is due to L2s feeling like "different chains" because of interoperability issues, branding, and fee structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

The vision is for L2s to have strong reasons to stay on Ethereum, such as tapping into L1 liquidity and benefiting from an economically important L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>. This involves providing valuable services to L2s, such as:
*   **Sequencing:** Base rollups can repurpose the L1 sequencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.
*   **Eliminating Overhead:** Native rollups can reduce the need for security councils and custom proof systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.
*   **Shared Resources:** Base and native rollups are seen as moving closer to truly being Ethereum by utilizing shared L1 resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.
*   **Reduced Switching Costs:** By making L2s that use Ethereum L1 services more "sticky" through R&D and developer resources, it becomes harder for them to leave the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.

A "product differentiation" is needed for L2s that are seamlessly integrated with the L1, making it a meaningfully better experience than being an independent chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.

## Block Times and Latency
While scaling L1 capacity is a priority, reducing block times is also seen as essential for improving DeFi as a product, lowering MEV, and enabling tighter market maker spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.

Key aspects of latency improvement:
*   **Optimistic Pre-confirmations:** Providing cryptoeconomic or best-effort promises of transaction inclusion and outcome, similar to sequencer guarantees on L2s, to improve user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>. The goal is to make these a core part of the Ethereum stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.
*   **Finality:** Accelerating finality primarily benefits L2 interaction and exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.
*   **Censorship Resistance Time:** Reducing the time a single block proposer has a monopoly on the slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.

Reducing slot times to potentially 6 seconds is considered a plausible medium-term step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>. Further reductions to potentially 1 second are very long-term and require significant changes to staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. These improvements must be achieved while maintaining Ethereum's core properties, such as global audibility and node participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

## Cultural and Leadership Changes at the EF
The [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum Foundation]] is undergoing a "pretty significant change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>. The new co-CEOs, Tomas and Shiao, are expected to bring more energy and focus on action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>.

Key shifts:
*   **Product Mindset:** A notable change in attitude towards adopting a product mindset, which was previously non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>.
*   **Communication:** Massively upgraded internal and external communication, with new leadership being more accessible and actively listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>.
*   **Focus on Action:** New leadership is "very much focused on action" rather than just long-winding research discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>.
*   **New Voices:** Efforts to bring in more diverse voices, such as product managers, who focus on user experience rather than purely technical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

While mindsets have shifted, the actual implementation and shift in the actors and their daily work is still a "big effort" and remains to be proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:46">[01:29:46]</a>.

## Overall Outlook
There is newfound optimism about Ethereum's direction, with strong consensus on the urgency and short-to-medium-term actions needed to restore growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The shift towards prioritizing shorter timeframes means that deeply technical long-term upgrades are finally ready to be unleashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The "Ethereum ship is turning around," moving from being slow to adapt to a clear path of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>. This turn is happening on a "3 months, not a three-year timeline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>. While there is still a lot of work to do, the sentiment is that Ethereum is "on the correct path to getting there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:19">[01:30:19]</a>.

Despite the challenges, Ethereum maintains core strengths that differentiate it from other ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a>. The current period of "hard times" is seen as a catalyst for creating "strong protocols" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:59">[01:31:59]</a>.

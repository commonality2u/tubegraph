The discussion around [[Ether as a commoditylike asset | Ether (ETH)]] as an asset often revolves around how it should be positioned and understood in the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This conversation is not new, but recent perspectives, particularly from Sam Kazemian of Frax Finance, suggest a different path than what the Ethereum community has been exploring for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Kazemian believes that valuing ETH using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is detrimental and should cease immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Instead, he advocates for ETH to be exclusively seen as a store of value commodity money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This perspective offers a potential solution to the challenges faced in ETH's valuation and its performance against other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Two Fundamental Asset Valuation Views

Generally, there are two primary ways to value an asset from a first-principles perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>:

1.  **Fundamentals View (Discounted Cash Flow)**: This approach treats the asset as equity-like, representing a claim on future cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It considers what the asset produces, whether through smart contracts or human effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
2.  **Commodity View**: In this view, the asset does not represent any claim on cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Its value is demand-based, often driven by industrial use cases or its function as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Gold, for example, is valued for its industrial uses (conductivity, malleability) and as a store of value held in vaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### The "Socially Constructed" Nature of Asset Value

Kazemian emphasizes that the definition and value of an asset like ETH are "socially constructed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. It's not merely about marketing; it's about a collective agreement that causally changes what the asset actually is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. For instance, if everyone believes a person is the "king of France" or the "president of the United States," that social agreement grants them actual power and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Similarly, for a digital asset like ETH, which is "zeros and ones" and cannot be physically consumed or used for shelter, its value is entirely dependent on social consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. A lack of unified social agreement results in "chaos" and diminishes the asset's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

## Ethereum's Asset Evolution and the ETH/BTC Ratio Decline

Kazemian has been involved in the Ethereum community since 2014, observing its full evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. He separates "ETH the technology" from "ETH the asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. While bullish on Ethereum's technology and its ethos of decentralized computation, he notes that technological advancement does not automatically equate to price appreciation of the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

The decline in the [[Ethereum and Bitcoin market performance and trends | ETH/BTC ratio]] since late 2021 (from 0.088 to 0.018) is attributed by Kazemian not to flaws in the technology itself (like Proof of Stake or EIP-1559), but to a shift in the asset's "social definition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

### Impact of EIP-1559 and Proof of Stake
The transition to Proof of Stake and the implementation of EIP-1559 fundamentally changed the predominant definition of [[Community faith and narrative around ETH as an asset | ETH the asset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. EIP-1559, which burns a portion of transaction fees, introduced a "cash flow" element to ETH, leading much of the community and external analysts (like Bloomberg ETF issuers) to predominantly analyze ETH through a DCF lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

Kazemian argues that focusing on this DCF model is effectively coordinating around the asset's "floor price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. The fees generated from blockspace demand represent an "industrial use case" for ETH, similar to gold's use in electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. However, valuing ETH primarily on these "burns" or "revenues" anchors its valuation to this minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. If ETH continues to be valued solely by its discounted cash flow, its price could theoretically drop to $500â€“$600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Narrative Strength

[[Cultural differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin communities | Bitcoin's (BTC)]] strength lies in its inherent structural property that forces its community to talk about the asset in one particular way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. Its Proof of Work mechanism, combined with its fixed 21 million supply, inherently makes it difficult to coherently discuss BTC in terms of discounted cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. This absence of a "DCF pitfall" has allowed the Bitcoin community to maintain a clear, unified social definition of BTC as a decentralized store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

Kazemian posits a thought experiment: if Bitcoin were to integrate an EIP-1559-like fee burn mechanism (BIP-1559), the Bitcoin community would likely *not* shift their primary narrative to DCF, because they are "well-trained" to avoid that discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. They would continue to emphasize its role as a national store of value for central banks, companies, and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.

## The Path Forward for Ethereum

Kazemian agrees with Ryan Sean Adams' "blue money religion" concept, which advocates for a more "zealot-like" and "cult-like" approach to defining [[Community faith and narrative around ETH as an asset | Ether the asset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This isn't about marketing, but about achieving internal community consensus on ETH's fundamental nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Re-emphasizing Commodity-like Properties
To shift away from the "floor price" mentality, Ethereum needs a social commitment to never change its emission algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. While a fixed total supply like Bitcoin's 21 million is not strictly necessary, the *predictability* and *simplicity* of Bitcoin's emission schedule make it easier for people to reason about its scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. ETH's current dynamic emission makes it harder to immediately grasp its supply without complex calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.

### Balancing Technology Product with Asset Narrative
The challenge for Ethereum is to balance its identity as a constantly evolving, "nice, pluralistic, open, big tent" technology platform with a "maximalist," "strong," and "unforgiving" narrative for [[Ethereums competitive position against Bitcoin | ETH the asset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>.

*   **Ethereum the Technology**: Needs to be the best possible product, with a culture of pragmatism and product-mindedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. This includes scaling Layer 1 and supporting Layer 2s, increasing transaction volumes, and potentially fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.
*   **Ether the Asset**: Requires a distinct, strong, and unified social definition, ideally as a commodity-like store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

The current focus on ETH's revenues (like through EIP-1559) and its ability to attract Real World Assets (RWAs) like BlackRock's BUIDL fund, while beneficial for the technology, can paradoxically limit the asset's perceived value if the narrative remains centered on "floor price" DCF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. Even if there are hundreds of billions in RWAs on Ethereum, if they have low velocity, the fees captured by EIP-1559 are minimal, and the "floor" doesn't significantly rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. In such a scenario, the Ethereum technology would be thriving, but the asset's price against Bitcoin might still lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.

Kazemian argues that without a clear, unified definition of [[Comparison between Bitcoin and Ethereums value narrative | ETH the asset]], the ecosystem remains in "chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>. He believes that [[Bitcoins rollupcentric roadmap and comparison with Ethereum | Ethereum's L2 roadmap]], while beneficial for the technology, currently benefits [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends | BTC the asset]] more than ETH, as L2s create more use cases for wrapped BTC as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

Ultimately, if the Ethereum community can purposefully address these narrative challenges, [[Ether as a commoditylike asset | ETH the asset]] has the potential to regain its position as a credible store of value alongside Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.

There is a noticeable shift in the focus of the [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] tech stack, moving towards becoming a very strong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategic pivot positively impacts Ether as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Ether as a Commodity
Ether, the asset, is envisioned as a commodity with a commodity-like shelling point and focus, serving as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This objective is bolstered by [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] having a strong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Higher fees and increased burn within [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] can enhance the strength of Ether as a commodity money within the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Duality in Approach
On the technology side of [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]], there is a need for "convexity Vitalik Buterin style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This suggests an adaptable and flexible approach for the underlying tech.

Conversely, for Ether the asset, the approach must shift to "concavity," being "extreme," and "maximalist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This creates a challenging tension for the [[ethereum_community_culture | community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>:
*   When discussing [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] as a product, the [[ethereum_community_culture | community]] needs to be adaptable, flexible, nice, and open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   When discussing Ether, the asset, the stance needs to be maximalist, strong, and unforgiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The challenge for the [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | ecosystem]] is to effectively operate in both lanes, choosing the appropriate stance based on the immediate context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For instance, addressing Wall Street about Ether the asset calls for a "yachty maximalist" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, while engaging application builders requires a pragmatic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This necessity to do both simultaneously is acknowledged as daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

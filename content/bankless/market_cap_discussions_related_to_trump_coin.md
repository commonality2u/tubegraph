Discussions surrounding the valuation and market capitalization of the [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump cryptocurrency]] have highlighted confusion regarding how these figures are presented and understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Value Surges and Specifics

The [[trump_official_memecoin_and_market_reactions | coin's value]] reportedly surged after an announcement that top holders would be invited to have dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. When questioned about the extent of this surge, it was stated to be 58% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Initial attempts to clarify the specific monetary value of the surge led to a figure of "14.32" being mentioned, which was clarified as "dollars per cryptocurrency," not "billion dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The memecoin's value was noted to have peaked at 7535 on January 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Market Cap and Valuation

There has been an ongoing discussion about the "multi-billion dollar market cap" of the [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump cryptocurrency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Commentators observed a reporter "struggling with the concept of like market cap" when asking about the current [[trump_official_memecoin_and_market_reactions | Trump]] market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The fully diluted valuation of the [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency]] was cited as $12.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. It was suggested that the interviewer might have been trying to elicit a public statement about the [[trump_official_memecoin_and_market_reactions | Trump coin]] being worth "$12 billion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, potentially to imply the interviewee was "profiting from the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Interviewee's Stance

The person interviewed stated, "I'm not profiting from anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, clarifying that the [[cryptocurrency_and_its_significance_according_to_trump | crypto initiative]] started "long before the election" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They also expressed support for [[cryptocurrency_and_its_significance_according_to_trump | crypto]], deeming it "important" due to international competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Interpretations of Response

Speculation arose that the interviewee either intentionally avoided stating the large valuation or genuinely did not understand the concept of market cap or its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The interviewee indicated that the specific price was "not important" to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

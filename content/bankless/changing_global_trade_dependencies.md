The global economic and political landscape is undergoing significant shifts, leading towards a new monetary order and a re-evaluation of international dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Breakdown of Existing Orders

The current domestic political and international world orders are "breaking down" due to unsustainable fundamental issues that are readily apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This breakdown signals the impending arrival of a "new world order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Rebalancing Trade Imbalances

A key aspect of this shift involves the rectification of [[global_trade_relations_and_trade_wars | trade imbalances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Specifically:
*   China needs to reduce its dependence on United States debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   The United States needs to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This rebalancing is expected to be a painful process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Monetary Policy Response to Pain

To alleviate the anticipated pain from these economic adjustments, there is a strong expectation that monetary authorities will resort to printing a significant amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This approach is seen as a way to "print ourselves into less suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Impact on Fiat Currencies

The consequence of widespread money printing will likely be a reduction in the value of fiat currencies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This aligns with the long-standing Bitcoiner thesis regarding monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Global Liquidity Cycles

Current projections for [[potential_changes_in_global_liquidity_and_their_implications | global liquidity]] (Global M2) indicate that a bottoming zone has been reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Following a period of decreasing global monetary liquidity in fiat systems, a new four-year liquidity cycle is beginning, with M2 projected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. If a [[the_potential_for_a_recession_and_global_economic_shifts | recession]] occurs, potentially leading to American capital flight, "the money printers are going to turn on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

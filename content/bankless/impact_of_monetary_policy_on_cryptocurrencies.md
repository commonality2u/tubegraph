Monetary policy, particularly changes in global liquidity and the actions of central banks, significantly influences the cryptocurrency market. Current projections and expert analyses suggest a new cycle of increasing global monetary liquidity, which is generally viewed as bullish for crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Global Liquidity Cycles

According to a chart by Ralph Paul, global M2 (a measure of the money supply) is a projection of global liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. After a cycle of decreasing global monetary liquidity in fiat systems over the past few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, the market has reached a bottoming zone for global M2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. A new cycle is beginning where M2 is projected to rise, which Ralph Paul characterizes as part of four-year liquidity cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Recession and Money Printing

The prospect of a recession, particularly with American capital flight, is anticipated to trigger a significant increase in money printing by central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This monetary expansion is considered a bullish signal for the crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's New Monetary Order

Ray Dalio's essay, "It's too late, the changes are coming," highlights the imminent shift to a new monetary order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. He argues that domestic political and international world orders are deteriorating due to measurable and unsustainable fundamental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Key points from Dalio's perspective include:
*   The impending arrival of a "new world order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   The need to address trade imbalances, such as China's dependency on United States debt and the United States' dependency on Chinese manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   The acknowledgment that these adjustments will cause economic pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Devaluation of Fiat Currencies
To alleviate the expected economic pain, there is a strong incentive for governments and central banks to print more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This action is expected to result in the devaluation of fiat currencies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This aligns with the long-standing Bitcoiner thesis that extensive monetary policy will lead to currency debasement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, strengthening the [[crypto_as_a_hedge_against_monetary_policy_shifts | crypto as a hedge against monetary policy shifts]] narrative and affirming the [[role_of_cryptocurrencies_as_money_and_store_of_value | role of cryptocurrencies as a store of value]].

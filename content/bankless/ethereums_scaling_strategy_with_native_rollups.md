From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Ethereum is exploring the frontier of native rollups as a core component of its scaling strategy, aiming to address issues of heterogeneity and strengthen the security and interoperability of its layer 2 (L2) ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The ultimate goal for rollups is to "become native," leading to increased Total Value Locked (TVL) and more users, which benefits both the rollup and [[ethereum_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Current Problems in the Rollup Landscape
When [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum]] decided to scale with rollups, it outsourced its scaling strategy to independent layer 2 teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This led to each team developing their own code for rollup design, resulting in a "non-homogenized" landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These diverse rollups, while scaling [[Ethereums Scaling and Bandwidth Optimization | Ethereum]], are not closely integrated with the main chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They possess different codebases, [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | security assumptions]], and compete to set their own standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Key problems include:
*   **Heterogeneity**: The varied designs lead to the perception that "Ethereum layer 2s are not Ethereum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This means a loss of the credible neutrality of the [[ethereum_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum Layer One]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Interoperability Challenges**: Current optimistic rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base have 7-day withdrawal windows due to their fault proof systems, making it difficult to transfer assets between chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Centralized Sequencers**: Many rollups currently use centralized sequencers, contributing to interoperability issues and centralization risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Redundant Development**: Every rollup must develop its own state transition function and proof system to prove validity to L1, leading to multiple standards and potential security vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Security Council Reliance**: Rollups today often rely on security councils (multi-sigs) to govern upgrades to their proof systems, creating a single point of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:00]</a>. This raises concerns about trust and property rights assurances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.
*   **Bugs from EVM Emulation**: The process of emulating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) introduces bugs, similar to how L1 clients can have bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Lack of Forward Compatibility**: L2s struggle to remain compatible with yearly EVM hard forks without trusting a governance mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## What are Native Rollups?
Native rollups are a design for [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum rollups]] that directly addresses the issue of non-homogeneous rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The core idea is to bake the [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | security of Ethereum]] rollups directly into the Layer One (L1) itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:19]</a>. This is achieved by introducing an EVM pre-compile directly into the [[ethereum_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum L1]] code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:38]</a>.

### The EVM Pre-compile
An EVM pre-compile is a complex instruction for the EVM that provides "introspection," allowing the L1 to verify the validity of its native rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:17]</a>. Instead of L2s like Optimism, Arbitrum, or Base maintaining their own fraud proofs and security councils, they can use this L1 pre-compile to access [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | Ethereum-level security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:56]</a>. This effectively shifts the burden of state validation from individual L2 teams to the [[ethereum_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum L1]] validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:34]</a>.

### Role of ZK Proofs
While a simple re-execution-backed pre-compile can be added, it wouldn't significantly scale [[ethereum_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum]] due to the L1's block gas limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:52]</a>. This is where [[Ethereums ZK scaling developments | ZK (Zero-Knowledge) proofs]] become crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:18]</a>. With [[Ethereums ZK scaling developments | ZK proofs]], instead of validators re-executing all transactions within the pre-compile, they simply verify a [[Ethereums ZK scaling developments | ZK proof]] of correct execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:38]</a>. This allows for calls to the execute pre-compile to use arbitrarily more gas, effectively scaling the L1 in a meaningful way by allowing for significantly increased gas limits (10x, possibly 1000x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:53]</a>.

### Delayed Execution
A proposed future upgrade called "delayed execution" further simplifies real-time proving for native rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:09]</a>. This mechanism allows L1 validators to delay the processing of state roots by one full slot (12 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:16]</a>. This gives those generating proofs a whole slot to produce them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:34]</a>. While validation happens in the next slot, from a user perspective, transactions are still instantaneous because the wallet knows it's a valid transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:31]</a>.

## Benefits of Native Rollups
Native rollups offer substantial improvements for the [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum rollup-centric roadmap]]:
*   **Enhanced Security**: Native rollups unlock a new, higher level of security by baking [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | Ethereum's security]] directly into the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:52]</a>. They extend [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | Ethereum's social consensus]] and L1 governance over critical parts of the rollup stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:27]</a>. This means users can feel more comfortable placing money on a rollup for extended periods, similar to L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Simplified Design**: Native rollups eliminate the need for L2s to "roll their own" fraud proof systems, security councils, or ancillary infrastructure like proving networks and watchtowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:19]</a>. This simplifies the L2 design to a single line of code calling the pre-compile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:21]</a>.
*   **Increased TVL and User Adoption**: The dramatically improved security and property rights assurances are expected to significantly increase the amount of [[Economic impact of native rollups on Ethereum | ETH]] bridged to L2s, which currently sits at a low 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:47:01]</a>.
*   **Homogeneous Standard**: By using the same pre-compile, native rollups implicitly share the same state transition function, creating a more homogeneous and uniform block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:29]</a>.
*   **[[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | Interoperability]]**: While shared execution offers better [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | security]], [[Economic impact of native rollups on Ethereum | composability]] is primarily unlocked when native rollups also use [[economic_impact_of_native_rollups_on_ethereum | base sequencing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:41]</a>. This leads to synchronous [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | composability]] by enabling real-time proving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:12]</a>.
*   **Quantum Security**: Native rollups inherently become post-quantum secure as soon as [[ethereum_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | L1 validators]] upgrade their systems, as there are no proofs on-chain to be concerned about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:53]</a>.
*   **Proof Aggregation**: The L1 validators can aggregate all proofs across native rollups behind the scenes, potentially leading to much lower gas costs for L2s to settle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:48]</a>.
*   **[[Economic impact of native rollups on Ethereum | Value Accrual for ETH]]**: Native rollups provide a new "product feature" for [[ethereum_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum]], making it more valuable to rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:05]</a>. This creates a stronger "lock-in" for rollups to use [[Ethereums Scaling and Bandwidth Optimization | Ethereum's Data Availability (DA)]], which is expected to be the largest source of [[economic_impact_of_native_rollups_on_ethereum | value accrual for Ethereum]] in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:54]</a>.

## Challenges and Trade-offs
*   **[[Technical challenges and execution for native rollups | Technical Hurdle]] for Existing Rollups**: For current rollups (like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base) to become native, they need to refactor their code to cleanly decouple user transaction execution (EVM state transition function) from system-level code (blob handling, sequencer, governance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:24]</a>.
*   **EVM Equivalence Requirement**: Becoming a native rollup is only possible for EVM-equivalent rollups that are trying to be as compatible as possible with the [[ethereum_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum EVM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:45:04]</a>. Rollups with entirely different virtual machines (like SVM, Move, Cairo, Wasm) cannot become native <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:54]</a>.
*   **Customizability vs. Standardisation**: While adopting the shared EVM standard offers benefits, it could limit the freedom of L2s to rapidly introduce new features like account abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:54]</a>. However, the prevailing trend shows L2s correcting course to maximize EVM compatibility, with customization primarily occurring outside the EVM, such as in tokenomics, governance, or specialized sequencing (e.g., UniChain's flash blocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:55:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:57:12]</a>.
*   **[[Coordination and governance in Ethereums rollup roadmap | Social Coordination]]**: The biggest bottleneck for implementing native rollups is the lack of a dedicated coordinator or champion to manage the extensive [[Coordination and governance in Ethereums rollup roadmap | coordination]] required among L2 teams, execution layer clients, and researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:16]</a>.

## Timeline and Roadmap
The process of integrating native rollups into the [[ethereum_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum Layer One]] involves several steps:
1.  **Finding a Coordinator**: A champion is needed to take full responsibility for this work, similar to how Tim B championed EIP-1559 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:58]</a>.
2.  **Hard Fork Implementation**: Once a coordinator is found, the process of writing an EIP, going through core developer discussions (all core devs), devnets, and testnets will take at least 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:44]</a>.
3.  **Initial Pre-compile (Re-execution Backed)**: With an accelerated hard fork cadence (aiming for two forks a year), an execute pre-compile backed by naive re-execution could potentially be introduced by the end of 2026 if there is sufficient demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:01:17]</a>. This version would immediately benefit optimistic rollups, as it's only called in the fraud proof game, which rarely occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:02:07]</a>.
4.  **Advanced Pre-compile (ZK-Backed)**: Projecting three years into the future, the execute pre-compile's gas limit could dramatically increase by being backed by [[Ethereums ZK scaling developments | ZK-SNARKs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:39]</a>. This requires:
    *   Delayed State Roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:50]</a>.
    *   Strong diversity of mature, real-time [[Ethereums ZK scaling developments | ZK-EVMs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:56]</a>.
    *   Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:04]</a>.
    Currently, the cost to generate a [[Ethereums ZK scaling developments | ZK proof]] for an L1 EVM block is mere cents, and proving times are around 2 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:45]</a>. Multi-machine proving with GPU clusters is expected to further reduce latency, potentially hitting the "next slot real-time proving" benchmark (12 seconds) within the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:17]</a>.
5.  **Beam Chain**: A parallel effort, the "beam chain," aims to tackle governance problems by focusing on R&D for years before entering the expensive social layer of upgrades, essentially batching governance at a higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:15:14]</a>.

This [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | rollup-centric roadmap]], coupled with innovations like native rollups, aims to unify rollups with [[ethereum_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum]] at both the sequencing and execution layers, turning them into "programmable shards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:16:29]</a>.

Concerns have been raised by non-Americans regarding the safety of keeping property domiciled in the United States of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These concerns stem from the possibility of [[capital_controls_and_repercussions | capital controls]] or taxes being imposed on foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Repercussions of Capital Exit

If capital exits US shores, there are significant repercussions, including a potential decline in the S&P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This scenario is likened to effects seen "post liberation day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Mathematically, to reduce the capital account surplus, foreigners must sell their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Impact on US Markets

Foreigners have historically parked trillions of dollars of export earnings into American markets, which has been the foundation for the outperformance of American property, stock, and [[us_bond_market_issues | bond markets]] over the last 30 years compared to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. If foreigners withdraw this capital, these markets are expected to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Even a small number of individuals beginning to leave can trigger market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Government Response and Economic Rebalancing

When markets, particularly the [[us_bond_market_issues | bond market]], experience declines and volatility increases, the response typically involves printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The consequence of [[capital_controls_and_repercussions | capital controls]] means that the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and politicians would all need to collaborate on policies to provide dollars to replace the departing foreign capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This replacement is expected to occur through the printing of more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Effects on Crypto and Gold

The predicted consequence of this economic rebalancing, specifically the printing of money to offset capital flight, is a significant increase in the value of gold and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This scenario is considered a beneficial outcome for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

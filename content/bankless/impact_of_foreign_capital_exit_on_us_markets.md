Concerns have arisen among non-Americans regarding the safety of keeping property domiciled in the United States, particularly in light of potential [[us_capital_controls_and_repercussions | capital controls]] or taxes on foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Such policies could lead to significant repercussions, including [[us_capital_controls_and_repercussions | capital exits US shores]] and a decline in the S&P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Historical Context of Foreign Capital
For the last 30 years, foreigners parking trillions of dollars of export earnings into American markets has been the fundamental basis for the outperformance of American property, stock, and bond markets compared to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Consequences of Capital Exit
Mathematically, for the capital account surplus to be reduced, foreigners must sell their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. If foreigners withdraw their capital, American property, stock, and bond markets are mathematically expected to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A marginal exodus of foreign capital can lead to rapid market shifts, similar to the period between April 2nd and April 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Policy Response and Market Reactions
When markets decline, particularly the bond market, and [[market_volatility_and_economic_uncertainty | volatility]] increases, the typical response is for authorities to "print money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The implementation of [[us_capital_controls_and_repercussions | capital controls]] would necessitate the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and politicians to collaborate on policies that provide dollars to replace the departing foreign capital, primarily through money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Impact on Crypto and Gold
This scenario of a [[rebalancing_of_the_global_economy_due_to_us_policies | rebalancing of the global economy]] due to capital exit and subsequent money printing is considered highly beneficial for [[crypto_market_reactions_to_economic_instability | cryptocurrencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The anticipated consequence is that both gold and Bitcoin would experience significant appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

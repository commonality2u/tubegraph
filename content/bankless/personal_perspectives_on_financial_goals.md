The concept of wealth has been extensively discussed, particularly in the context of crypto. However, a crucial aspect often overlooked is the personal definition of "enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Defining "Enough"

For one individual, "enough" signifies a financial threshold that allows for everything they and their family desire to do in life, ensuring provision for loved ones without needing to constantly monitor financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This perspective isn't rooted in greed, but rather in the enjoyment of the "game" of growing a business and [[investment_strategies_and_risk | investing in the right ways]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

It's important to note that this "enough" is not about acquiring flashy status symbols like a luxury car; instead, it's likened to achieving a "high score" in an arcade game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A significant missing piece in this personal journey was the explicit act of [[defining_financial_enough | defining "enough"]] in collaboration with a spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Broadening the Definition of Wealth

Initially, personal definitions of [[comprehensive_definitions_of_wealth | wealth]] can be too narrow, predominantly focusing on net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Society often imposes this singular view of success as a "number go up" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

However, financial wealth is merely one type of wealth. A more comprehensive understanding includes:
*   Time wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Relationships/social wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Mental wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Physical wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

Recognizing these diverse forms of wealth can lead to the realization of an over-allocation in the financial aspect, highlighting the necessity of [[balancing_different_types_of_wealth | taking care of the other types of wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Every Layer 1 (L1) blockchain features a native token, commonly referred to as a Layer 1 token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Understanding how to value these tokens is crucial for investors who want to know what drives returns and evaluate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This valuation framework allows analysts to determine if a token is over or undervalued and enables comparisons between different blockchains like Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The vast majority of the total crypto market capitalization (over $3 trillion) is comprised of Layer 1 tokens, with Bitcoin alone accounting for about 63% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Historical Valuation Approaches

Historically, various methods have been attempted to value L1 tokens:

*   **MV=PQ (Quantity Theory of Money)**: This monetary theory, popular around 2016-2017, centers the [[valuation_of_layer_1_blockchain_tokens|valuation of Layer 1 blockchain tokens]] on the velocity of money (rate of spending) equaling price times output or nominal GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It has since fallen out of favor for valuing L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Stock-to-Flow (S2F)**: Popularized by Bitcoiners, this model assumes scarcity (measured by the ratio of existing supply to annual issuance) directly drives value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. While comparable to gold's demand-supply dynamics, S2F is criticized for being supply-side focused and assuming infinite persistent demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Relative Valuation**: A more current approach, especially for Bitcoin, involves comparing its market cap to that of traditional assets like gold, with discussions focusing on what percentage of gold's market Bitcoin can capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This approach considers the disruption of analog incumbents by digital versions, often leading to the digital disruptor surpassing the analog in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Current Consensus & Critique

As of May 2025, a common consensus among analysts is that Bitcoin is a "special snowflake" [[comparison_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_asset_narratives|Comparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin asset narratives]] and can be valued akin to gold, serving as a monetary store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. However, other L1 assets are often valued differently, typically based on "REV" (revenue) using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Understanding REV and DCF in Crypto

REV measures the fees users pay to L1 validators, representing the value captured from transaction activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Analysts interpret REV as company cash flows, feeding it into a DCF model to value L1 tokens like traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. DCF, a method where the present value of an asset is the sum of all future cash flows discounted, became consensus for valuing equity assets in the traditional stock market by 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Why DCF Falls Short for L1 Tokens

A critical critique of applying DCF to L1 tokens is that these tokens are not company shares and do not accrue value like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Validators earn staking yield in their native token (e.g., ETH, SOL), not a non-native currency like USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This creates a circular reference, as the value is not fundamentally tied to an external asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

> "If one person, one account, one wallet owned the entire supply of ETH, of Soul, of BTC, of TAN, of Bitensor, of whatever... the value of that would be zero because... there's no one paying fees, there's no doing anything, right? There's only the entire supply is in one wallet." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>

This thought experiment, reminiscent of Metcalfe's Law, highlights that money is a network; its value is derived from its widespread use and participation, not from internal compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. While REV offers a snapshot of current demand to use a blockchain, measuring aggregate transaction fees in dollar terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, it's insufficient for a global valuation metric due to the native currency payment and the impending deflation of fees as [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one|Ethereum Layer One Scaling]] improves and other chains scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## Layer 1 Tokens as Money

L1 tokens, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, function as money because they meet its precise definition: "any asset that's primarily used to make payments and as a store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

*   **Payments**: L1 tokens are used for on-chain services and goods, with all transactions paid for in the native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **Store of Value (SOV)**: They are used for staking (taking duration risk for yield) and as a deposit asset in DeFi, akin to traditional bonds and bank deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

L1 tokens occupy a unique position, "splitting the difference between a nation-state fiat money and a commodity money like gold or copper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. Their status as money is derived from actual usage, not simply government decree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.

The **store of value** use case is argued to be the dominant driver of value for L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. While transaction fees (payments) deflate as blockchains scale and increase block space supply (e.g., Ethereum's potential 100x block space expansion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>, the supply of L1 tokens for SOV remains relatively constrained (e.g., ETH's maximum 2% annual inflation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. Therefore, demand growth for SOV is not met with proportional supply increases, leading to price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

## Realized Store of Value (RSOV)

A new framework, **Realized Store of Value (RSOV)**, aims to provide a more holistic valuation metric for L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

RSOV tracks two primary drivers of SOV demand for L1 tokens, measuring "ground truth real usage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>:

1.  **Realized value of L1 tokens staked**: This measures the cumulative dollar value of tokens committed to staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.
2.  **Realized value of L1 tokens in DeFi**: This tracks the cumulative dollar value of tokens deposited into decentralized finance protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

Inspired by Bitcoin's "realized cap" (the aggregate cost basis of the entire network) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>, RSOV for smart contract platforms measures the aggregate cost basis of value specifically tied to these two core use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. When users buy and stake ETH at a higher price, or deposit it into DeFi protocols like MakerDAO or Uniswap, RSOV increases, reflecting net cumulative dollar inflows into the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>. This also reduces the velocity of the token, as it is being "hodl'd" in supply sinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

### RSOV and REV Relationship

REV (transaction fees) and RSOV are interrelated. Higher REV can lead to increased staking yield, which incentivizes more users to stake. As stakers compound their earnings by holding the native token, this activity contributes to the growth of RSOV, effectively showing REV growing RSOV "one block at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. In essence, high REV signifies a "hastening transfer of [L1 token] from spenders to savers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>.

## Total Addressable Market (TAM)

When viewing L1 tokens as money, the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for digital non-sovereign money is significantly larger than if they were valued as companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

Currently, digital crypto money (L1 tokens) sits at approximately $2.5 trillion, while analog and government-based money (gold plus fiat base money) is around $45 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. This represents a potential "20x upside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

> "The market is going to increasingly see these digital crypto monies as increasingly credible stores of value relative to the fiat alternatives which by the way are going through their own sort of periods of crisis here and and those the drivers of that crisis seem to be accelerating not decelerating." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>

The argument is that digital disruptors historically grow larger than their physical incumbents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>. Valuing L1s based on their monetary properties rather than solely on DCF comps unlocks a much larger potential market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

## RSOV in Practice and Its Drivers

The gap between an L1 token's market cap and its RSOV indicates how much future growth is currently priced in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. For example, if SUI has a price-to-RSOV ratio of 185x, it suggests a significant amount of future SOV growth is anticipated, implying it's "expensive as a store of value" on current metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

**Factors that increase RSOV:**

*   **Inflows into staking**: Driven by higher staking yields or a change in market perception (lower perceived risk) making the yield more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
*   **Inflows into DeFi**: Increased use of the L1 token as a deposit asset for collateral or liquidity within DeFi protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.
*   **Growing asset issuance across the network**: As more compatible assets (like stablecoins or tokenized BTC) become available on-chain, they facilitate more L1 token pairings in DeFi, leading to increased usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>.
*   **Monetary attributes**: Reliable issuance policies, hardened protocol rules, and easy-to-verify chains enhance the L1 token's appeal as a trustworthy digital money, similar to how nation-states' financial policies affect their fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.

The debate about [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem|the role of layer 1 and layer 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem]] and whether L2s are parasitic or synergistic often revolves around their impact on revenue/fees (REV). However, for RSOV, the presence of L2s is unequivocally beneficial, as they can lead to more users buying and using the L1 token in DeFi across various chains (e.g., ETH used in DeFi on Base or Arbitrum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. This increases the network's realized value. [[layer_1_and_layer_2_integration_in_ethereum|Layer 1 and Layer 2 integration in Ethereum]] can create a scenario where L2s improve user experience and onboard capital, without necessarily diluting the native yield of the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.

Conversely, events like censorship can negatively impact RSOV. For instance, the SUI validator's action to freeze a hacker's funds, while intended to protect, demonstrated a lack of censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. While SUI remains a currency, such actions can deter users from storing value in it due to perceived risk, akin to how countries react to the freezing of reserves by a nation-state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This highlights that while an L1 token might still be "money," censorship makes it "bad money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.

## Conclusion

L1 tokens should be understood and valued as commodities or money, not as equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>. Attempting to apply DCF to an asset that functions as money is trying to fit a "square peg in a round hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:47">[01:33:47]</a>, as many traditional assets like gold or fiat currencies cannot be valued this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:58">[01:33:58]</a>.

Ethereum, for example, is seen as pursuing both the "digital gold" (SOV) narrative and the "cash flow" (REV) narrative. While this complexity can be challenging to reconcile for some, it suggests a comprehensive approach to value accrual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:39">[01:29:39]</a>.

From an RSOV perspective, Ethereum is considered "undervalued" compared to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>. Its current market cap relative to Bitcoin (around 15%) is seen as disproportionately low given its potential for monetary inflows and its strong monetary attributes like censorship resistance, low inflation, and widespread acceptance in on-chain finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>. Key catalysts like real-time proving and base rollups are expected to increase ETH staking yield and attract significant inflows, bolstering its RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

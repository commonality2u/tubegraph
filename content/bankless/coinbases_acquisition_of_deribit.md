## Details of the Acquisition

## Strategic Importance

Deribit is an offshore options platform for [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] and [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Ether]], which currently does not allow US citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>. It is known for handling the largest volume of options in the crypto space, specifically 90% of [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] and [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | ETH]] options open interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. Deribit is located in Panama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

This acquisition positions [[coinbases_inclusion_in_the_sp_500 | Coinbase]] to directly compete with traditional finance entities like the CME and other derivatives platforms in the United States, with the goal of making these offerings available to US citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. It is suggested that [[coinbases_inclusion_in_the_sp_500 | Coinbase]] identified an opportunity due to a "soften regulatory regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. The move is expected to cement [[coinbases_inclusion_in_the_sp_500 | Coinbase]]'s lead as an exchange and positions it for a "big stable coin win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.

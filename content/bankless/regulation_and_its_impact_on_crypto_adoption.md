Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of ETFs and Index Investments at BlackRock, discusses the [[impacts_of_regulation_on_the_crypto_market | impact of regulation]] on the crypto industry, particularly regarding the adoption and success of Bitcoin and Ether Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of regulation in fostering market resilience, transparency, and accessibility for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Bitcoin and Ether ETPs as Bridges

The introduction of Bitcoin ETPs in the US, nearly a year prior to this discussion, created a bridge between the crypto world and traditional finance (TradFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This bridge proved useful for both TradFi investors seeking familiar wrappers for crypto exposure and digital-native investors who found the ETP structure beneficial for portfolio diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Samara Cohen notes that some investors bought their first ETP in the Bitcoin ETPs and are now diversifying into other ETPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Measuring ETP Success
In the ETF industry, a successful ETP is measured by several factors:
*   **Precision Tracking:** The ETP must track its underlying index with absolute precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Bitcoin ETPs addressed a need for investors to hold Bitcoin in a TradFi wrapper that accurately tracked its price, unlike previous futures ETFs or proxy stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **Market Quality:** This involves an ecosystem of players, such as authorized participants, ensuring trading volumes, liquidity, and on-exchange access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Both Bitcoin and Ether ETPs have demonstrated high market quality and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

A common misconception is that creating an ETP drives flows; however, investor sentiment is the primary driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. While Bitcoin ETPs broke historical records, Ether ETPs still ranked in the top 20% of US ETF launches for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. The investment thesis for Bitcoin was more tangible to investors in 2024, particularly in times of heightened geopolitical tension and concern over broad disruptions or the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Bitcoin's role as a potential diversifier against traditional 60/40 equity-bond portfolios, especially after the difficult 2022 market, also contributed to its appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. In contrast, the Ether story is often seen as an amplifier to existing tech exposures rather than a diversifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

### Impact of Options on Market Quality
The launch of options on Bitcoin ETPs was a significant development, contributing to market quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Options ecosystems generally create more balanced trading dynamics and provide a new level of transparency and access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. They allow investors to tailor exposures, participate with limited downside, and achieve income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. Historically, many institutional investors first engaged with exchange-traded funds through options on those funds, seeking limited capital outlay and downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.

## Misconceptions about ETFs and Price
A common misconception in the crypto community is that an ETP's success is measured by the price appreciation of the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. Samara Cohen clarifies that this is not how BlackRock measures ETP success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. She states that launching an ETF does not magically create price appreciation or liquidity for the underlying asset; rather, demand for the underlying drives the ETF's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.

BlackRock believes that education about risk management and portfolio interactions is the best marketing for Bitcoin, not price action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. While Bitcoin's price volatility has dropped, it remains a risky, volatile asset compared to most other portfolio holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.

## The Future of Regulation in Crypto
Looking ahead to 2025, BlackRock hopes to see the establishment of fundamental [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | regulatory developments]] in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>. Key areas include:
*   **Basic Definitions:** Clear definitions for crypto assets, such as what constitutes a security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>.
*   **Jurisdiction:** Clarifying which regulators (e.g., [[regulatory_shifts_with_the_sec_cftc_and_implications_for_the_crypto_industry | SEC or CFTC]]) are responsible for different aspects of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
*   **Interoperability:** More work around interoperability to allow TradFi market experts to play a larger role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

BlackRock expresses optimism for a more innovation-supportive [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | regulatory environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. However, they emphasize the critical need to strike a balance between supporting innovation and ensuring appropriate investor protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. A lack of guardrails can undermine investor confidence, which is vital for the market to reach its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.

Regarding existing bills like FIT21 and the [[regulatory_developments_and_challenges_for_stablecoins | stablecoin bill]], the hope is for better integration with existing TradFi frameworks rather than creating a completely separate crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. This would allow existing players to invest without facing duplicative regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

## BlackRock's Approach to Digital Assets
BlackRock has a dedicated digital assets team led by Robbie Mitnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. This team operates horizontally, educating all business units across the firm (ETFs, index trading, cash securities, lending, derivatives) on potential use cases for digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.
The firm has publicly pivoted towards leaning more into public versus permissioned blockchains from a tokenization perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. This aligns with their preference for open architecture and interoperability, which is essential for operating at BlackRock's scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

BlackRock's near-term ETP strategy remains focused on Bitcoin and Ether, based on client interest and portfolio relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Beyond new ETPs, the firm is highly focused on tokenization, particularly of Treasury funds, and the future path of [[regulatory_developments_and_challenges_for_stablecoins | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>.

## Optimism for the Future
Samara Cohen expresses hope and optimism for 2025, particularly for a return to a more innovation-supportive environment in US markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. She hopes the industry can focus on its core mission: creating a more transparent and accessible financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. This aligns with the broader crypto industry's call for a "golden age" of innovation, enabled by abundant and cheap block space, and clearer [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | regulatory skies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>.

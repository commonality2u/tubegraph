## Tariff Truce Announced
The United States and China have reached an agreement to pause their ongoing tariffs, leading to a positive market response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>. The news, initially circulated via a Truth Social tweet, broke over a weekend when traditional markets were closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>. Bitcoin did not immediately react to the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. However, upon markets opening on Monday, a significant rally ensued, marking a "very green week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The NASDAQ jumped approximately 4%, and the S&P 500 rose about 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

Negotiations between Scott Bessant and Chinese representatives in Geneva led to this agreement, where both sides decided to lower reciprocal tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Tariffs, which had reached triple-digit rates like 115% and 145%, are now set to be reduced to 30% and 10% respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This recent phase of tariff conflict began barely a month prior, on April 2nd, known as [[Trumps Liberation Day reciprocal tariffs announcement | Liberation Day]], characterized by a tit-for-tat exchange between the Trump administration and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This reset to lower amounts is expected to last for at least 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Mark Williams, Chief Asia Economist at Capital Economics, described this as a "substantial deescalation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook on Tariffs
Some analysts believe that tariffs may slowly become irrelevant over time, viewing them as a negotiating tactic from the first year of a presidential administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This aligns with a significant decrease in the PolyMarket odds of a US recession in 2025, which spiked down from 66% to below 40% following the tariff truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Broader Economic Implications: Beyond Tariffs
Prominent figures like crypto trader Arthur Hayes and Scottish monetary historian Russell Napier suggest that while the tariff season might be over permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>, the Trump administration still aims to reduce the [[US economic policies and trade tariffs | US trade deficit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. This objective is driven by goals of national capitalism and re-industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.

### Devaluing the Dollar and Capital Repression
According to Arthur Hayes, the administration seeks to devalue the dollar and US treasuries, moving away from the Triffin dilemma and preventing the hollowing out of American manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>. Since tariffs proved politically unpopular and caused geopolitical blowback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>, the pivot is expected towards "capital repression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

This could involve actions such as a 2% tax on all foreign assets in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>. The current global monetary system sees America accumulate debt and consume imports, while Asia provides cheap labor and receives dollars and treasuries, which are then reinvested into [[Impact on American markets | US capital markets]], including the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and additional treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. There are an estimated $33 trillion of foreign-owned capital assets in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. The idea is that "foreigners are going to pay for our taxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.

This perspective aligns with Ray Dalio's views on China reducing its dependency on the USD and the US bolstering its manufacturing due to national security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>. The current deal, where China reinvests dollars back into the US economy, particularly by buying American companies like Apple or Google, could eventually lead to China owning a significant portion of US industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. Unwinding this system is seen as potentially painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.

### Investment Strategies in this Environment
Both Arthur Hayes and Russell Napier agree that bonds are a "toxic asset" to own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>. Hayes suggests that the solution for selling bonds held by foreign entities would involve money printing by the Federal Reserve (perhaps under a new name like "fiscal stimulus") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>. This could lead other countries to seek alternative store-of-value assets like gold and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>. Napier recommends a portfolio allocation of 25% gold and 75% value-based stocks that generate cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>. This scenario, involving potential Quantitative Easing (QE) and fiscal stimulus, creates a bullish environment for non-traditional assets, as seen by Bitcoin's all-time highs and gold's even higher values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>.

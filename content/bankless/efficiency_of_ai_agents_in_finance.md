The rapidly evolving [[development_of_ai_agents_and_their_market_impact | AI agent]] space is generating significant excitement, primarily driven by the core value of efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The [[ai_in_the_crypto_space | AI rollup]] podcast consistently covers recent news, developments, and drama at the intersection of crypto and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Core Value: Efficiency

The fundamental reason for the excitement surrounding [[development_of_ai_agents_and_their_market_impact | AI agents]] is their ability to enhance efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. While the term "efficiency" might sound corporate, it refers to making markets, [[trends_in_defi_and_ai_agents | DeFi]] applications, and gaming significantly more efficient to use and interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This represents a "real step change" that many people are not yet discussing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Addressing Blockchain Clunkiness

Blockchains are acknowledged as being "clanky" and "clunky" in their current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. [[development_of_ai_agents_and_their_market_impact | AI agents]] are positioned to significantly improve user experience by simplifying complex blockchain interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

An example given is a "Banker bot" on Farcaster, which allowed a user to quickly buy $90 of a meme coin with a simple command, bypassing the need to open a wallet or find a Ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This illustrates how [[ai_agent_integration_with_financial_systems | AI agents]] make internet interactions easier, especially for clunky and hard-to-navigate systems like blockchains, which are the main beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

[!INFO] Market Perception of AI Agents
The majority of the market has not yet "priced in" the vision for [[the_potential_financial_value_and_market_growth_of_ai_agent_networks | AI agent]] efficiency and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This creates an asymmetric value for those aware, highlighting the early stage of the development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Stages of [[trends_in_defi_and_ai_agents | DeFi]] Integration

The integration of [[ai_in_the_crypto_space | AI]] into [[trends_in_defi_and_ai_agents | DeFi]] can be broadly split into three stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>:

1.  **Abstract away complexity:** Making [[trends_in_defi_and_ai_agents | DeFi]] easier to use for newcomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.
2.  **Enable [[ai_agent_integration_with_financial_systems | agents]] with [[trends_in_defi_and_ai_agents | DeFi]] capabilities:** Plugging [[development_of_ai_agents_and_their_market_impact | agents]] into [[trends_in_defi_and_ai_agents | DeFi]] engines for automated actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.
3.  **Enhance apps natively:** Integrating AI into existing applications for improved user experience or backend operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

### Abstracting Complexity with Agent Engines

"Agent engines" are envisioned as "chat GPTs for crypto" where users can interact via a chat interface using natural language processing to perform complex crypto tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

> "The fact is David, [[trends_in_defi_and_ai_agents | DeFi]] is just hard to use no matter what we do, it's still a pretty daunting experience... there's so many things to kind of check and double check before you actually do something within [[trends_in_defi_and_ai_agents | DeFi]] it's not easy for a newcomer to come on board and do these things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>

These engines will understand nuanced requests, like bridging coins between chains to buy something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.

**Examples of Agent Engines:**

*   **Graffan:** An "agent engine" with a user interface similar to Chat GPT, featuring a wallet panel and "agent apps" that can perform tasks like "aping" into tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. It can also autonomously create tokens and airdrop them to specific NFT holders or token holders by processing on-chain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **The Hive Mind:** This team developed a use case for abstracting away the complexity of staking, making it much easier for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.
*   **Wayfinder:** This platform enables users to design "paths" for agents to follow, such as managing liquidity pools for yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. Developers who pioneer these paths can earn a percentage of fees or profits generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. Wayfinder also demonstrates agents autonomously writing and deploying smart contracts for creating tokens or staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

### Enabling [[ai_agent_integration_with_financial_systems | DeFi-Enabled Agents]]

The next logical step is to plug specialized [[development_of_ai_agents_and_their_market_impact | agents]] into these agent engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. This allows [[development_of_ai_agents_and_their_market_impact | agents]] to command interfaces and write prompts based on their predefined missions or visions, leading to more autonomous and efficient operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>. This concept aligns with "swarms" of "agentic entities," where an "operator agent" manages employee agents to execute tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

### Enhancing Apps Natively

This stage involves integrating [[ai_in_the_crypto_space | AI]] into existing applications to improve user experience or leverage agents for backend functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>. Examples include:
*   Making the user experience easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.
*   Leveraging agents to pull data for certain things instead of using an oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>.
*   Autonomously managing risk or treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.

## Revolutionizing User Experience and Security

The integration of [[ai_in_the_crypto_space | AI]] into [[trends_in_defi_and_ai_agents | DeFi]] is expected to deliver the best user experience for financial tools and assets that the average human has ever had, by hooking into the permissionless nature of [[trends_in_defi_and_ai_agents | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>. While initial stages may be "clunky" with potential for money loss, hacks, and exploits, continued development will refine and polish these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

Furthermore, [[ai_agent_integration_with_financial_systems | AI agents]] are seen as a potential solution to the prevalent phishing attacks in crypto, which have cost users billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. By having bots "error correcting" on behalf of users managing their own private keys and transactions, security could be significantly enhanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. This transition is viewed as the "future of finance and the future of UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

It is also anticipated that large language models (LLMs) will understand individuals "way more than any kind of family member or any kind of maybe even partner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:17">[01:52:17]</a>, by being trained on personal habits, data, and preferences, allowing them to predict user needs and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:40">[01:52:40]</a>. This will lead to a much better user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:10">[01:53:10]</a>.

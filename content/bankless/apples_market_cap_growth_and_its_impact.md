In 2006, when Apple released the iPhone, its market capitalization was approximately $70 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. At that time, ExxonMobil was the world's largest company, with a market cap of around $350 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The perceived upper limit for Apple, a company known for "toy consumer devices," was thought to be about five times its 2006 value, reaching a valuation comparable to the leading oil company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This provides a clear [[comparison_of_apple_and_exxonmobil_market_caps | Comparison of Apple and ExxonMobil market caps]] at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Unprecedented Growth and New Industry Creation

Fast forward to today, Apple has achieved a $4 trillion market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This significant growth in [[Impact of Market Valuations and Crypto Assets | market valuation]] stems from its success in creating an entirely new industry on top of the existing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This new industry ultimately proved to be worth considerably more than the oil industry, which previously dominated global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This expansion reflects a profound [[impact_on_american_markets | impact on American markets]] and the global economy.

## Analogous Future Growth in Robotics

The economic shift demonstrated by Apple's growth serves as an analogy for potential future developments in other sectors, particularly [[Impact of AI advancements on global markets | robotics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The productive output of an economy is determined by productivity per workforce multiplied by the workforce itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. With advancements in robotics, the workforce size is expected to expand exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Robots offer a much cheaper alternative to human labor, making it a compelling option for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This transition is anticipated to decrease the cost of goods due to lower employment expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> It is posited that a robotics company could one day exceed Apple's current $4 trillion market cap, aggressively replacing and multiplying the human workforce's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This parallels Apple's trajectory, where it transcended previous perceived market limits by creating a new economic paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

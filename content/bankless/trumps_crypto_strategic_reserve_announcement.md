[[Donald Trumps cryptocurrency | Donald J Trump]] announced a proposed US crypto strategic reserve, causing significant discussion and market reactions within the cryptocurrency industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

## The Announcement
On the morning of March 2nd, [[Donald Trumps cryptocurrency | Donald J Trump]] posted on Truth Social, stating that a "US crypto Reserve" would "Elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. He linked this to his [[trumps_procrypto_presidency_impacts | executive order on digital assets]], which directed a presidential working group to move forward on a [[crypto_strategic_reserve_and_market_reactions | crypto strategic Reserve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:37]</a>.

Initially, the post did not mention Bitcoin or Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. However, it was later "re-truthed" to include Bitcoin, Ether, and "other valuable cryptocurrencies" as the heart of the reserve, specifically naming XRP, Solana, and Cardano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Trump also stated, "I will make the US the crypto capital of the world making America great again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## Market Reaction
Following the initial announcement, cryptocurrency markets rallied significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
*   Cardano rose by about 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.
*   Solana increased by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   Ripple (XRP) went up 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
*   Ether saw a 13% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.
*   Bitcoin was up 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

Almost $300 billion was added to the total Bitcoin market cap in 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

However, markets soon reversed course by Monday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. This reversal was attributed to a combination of [[Donald Trumps cryptocurrency | Donald Trump's]] subsequent announcement of tariffs and a growing realization that the proposed reserve faced significant hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. PolyMarket, a prediction market, priced the likelihood of a [[the_concept_of_strategic_bitcoin_reserves | Bitcoin Reserve]] at 65%, but the likelihood for Solana was around 31-32%, indicating market skepticism about broader altcoin inclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

## Analysis and Criticisms
The announcement, particularly the inclusion of altcoins beyond Bitcoin, drew strong criticism and skepticism:

*   **Unilateral Action**: The proposal to buy various cryptocurrencies would require Congressional appropriation, as the government does not hold assets like Cardano or Solana from criminal seizures, unlike Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. Congress is considered unlikely to approve such purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.
*   **Politicization and Lobbying**: The inclusion of specific altcoins raised concerns about lobbying efforts. Laura Shin reported that Ripple allegedly pitched Solana's inclusion to make Ripple's own participation seem more legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. This has led to the realization that lobbying could be a high-leverage way to influence asset prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
*   **Departure from Crypto Ethos**: Critics argue this move is shortsighted and corrupting for the industry. Historically, early Bitcoin developers like Satoshi were cautious about attracting government attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. Now, companies appear to be asking the government to "buy my bags" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.
*   **Government Control**: For tokens with on-chain governance like Cardano, government ownership of a significant amount could implicitly give the US government control over the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. This could lead to a situation where the chain must comply with government wishes to avoid token dumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Strategic Value**: While a [[the_concept_of_strategic_bitcoin_reserves | Bitcoin Reserve]] might have some strategic financial investment value (similar to gold), holding other altcoins has "no value to the US government at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Interests**: The move is seen as downstream of the crypto industry's support for [[Donald Trumps cryptocurrency | Donald Trump]] and his responsiveness to incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. Given the Trump family's involvement in crypto projects (e.g., [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | his meme coin]] on Solana, World Liberty Financial on Ethereum), this initiative is viewed as "obviously suspect" and not for broader strategic interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.
*   **"Crazy" Scheme**: Nick Carter, a prominent crypto commentator, rated the crypto reserve featuring Cardano and Ripple as "10 out of 10 crazy" and "completely unhinged," calling it a "government bailout for your buddy who gets crypto news from TikTok" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>.

## Debate on the Purpose of a Crypto Reserve
There is a debate on whether a [[crypto_strategic_reserve_and_market_reactions | crypto strategic reserve]] is necessary or beneficial:

*   **No Reserve**: One perspective argues that no reserve is needed at all, as gold and oil reserves serve different purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin Only**: Another view suggests that if there is a reserve, it should be Bitcoin-only due to its decentralized nature and established position as a potential global reserve asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. The US government already possesses billions in Bitcoin from criminal seizures and could choose not to auction it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. Bitcoin is considered "beyond anybody's control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin and Ether**: A minority view suggests the possibility of including both Bitcoin and Ether, acknowledging the latter's significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.

The hosts concluded that broader altcoin inclusions would make the reserve "too messy" and "too corrupting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>. Such a policy would likely be reversed by the next administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.

## Trump's Broader Economic Approach
The discussion also touched on [[Donald Trumps cryptocurrency | Donald Trump's]] broader economic policies and their impact on markets.
*   **Trade Wars**: Trump confirmed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 20% on tariff goods from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:00">[25:33:00]</a>. These tariffs have been selectively rolled back for certain industries, such as automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>. Economists generally view tariffs as economically destructive, essentially taxing domestic consumers and making trade more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:00">[30:26:00]</a>.
*   **Rebalancing the Economy**: [[Donald Trumps cryptocurrency | Donald Trump's]] administration aims to rebalance the economy, favoring "Main Street" (small businesses and consumers) over "Wall Street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>. This includes a perceived willingness for the stock market to go down while favoring bonds and lower yields to refinance short-term debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37:00">[33:37:00]</a>.
*   **Trump's Pragmatism**: Despite the chaos, it was argued that Trump is adaptable. He "does stuff and he sees what sees what how things react" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:38:00">[38:38:00]</a>. If his policies (like tariffs) are not well-received, he is likely to walk them back, as he has also stated a desire to lower interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>.

In the end, while [[trumps_crypto_executive_order | Trump's Antics with the crypto strategic reserves]] caused short-term market volatility and raised questions about the industry's alignment with government, the overall sentiment is that the long-term trend for crypto remains positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>.

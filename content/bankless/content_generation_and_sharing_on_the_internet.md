The current landscape of content generation and sharing on the internet presents a significant challenge to existing frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The problem is approached by identifying the issues first, then working towards a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Challenge of Outdated Copyright Systems

The existing copyright system is largely outdated for the pace at which content is generated online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This system, originating from the era of the printing press, was effective for media like books, radio, and television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These traditional channels were characterized by a top-down distribution model where control over content and enforcement of royalties (e.g., for songs on radio stations or films on TV) was manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

However, the internet revolutionized content distribution, making everything [[peertopeer_content_distribution | peer-to-peer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This shift led to a proliferation of content creators, with content being remixed and shared at extremely high speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Exponential Growth Driven by AI

The challenge is further amplified by [[impact_of_ai_on_content_creation | AI]], which has caused an exponential increase in content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Currently, petabytes of content are generated daily, potentially even millions of petabytes per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This immense volume means the current copyright system is unable to support the present reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Need for a New IP System

There is a pressing need for a new Intellectual Property (IP) system that is compatible with the internet's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Such a system should be programmable, allowing any newly created IP to be instantly registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Furthermore, it must enable new content derived from existing material to be seamlessly licensed and fairly attributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

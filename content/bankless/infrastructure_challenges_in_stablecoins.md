The [[development of stablecoins]] for payments is considered to be only about 5% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The global payments market is substantial, with an estimated $200 trillion in annual [[crossborder payments with stablecoins|cross-border transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Currently, approximately $50 billion of these [[crossborder payments with stablecoins|cross-border payments]] are conducted using [[Stablecoins and their significance in fintech|stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The "Infrastructure Problem" for Stablecoins

[[Stablecoins and their significance in fintech|Stablecoins]] are regarded as functionally and unequivocally superior for specific payment use cases, provided that the underlying [[infrastructure required for stablecoin payments]] problem is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Solving these infrastructure challenges is crucial for the broader adoption and utility of [[Stablecoins and their significance in fintech|stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Key Infrastructure Challenges

The primary hurdles for [[infrastructure required for stablecoin payments]] include:
*   **[[Regulatory landscape and compliance in stablecoins|Compliance Concerns]]** Ensuring adherence to various regulatory frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Liquidity** Establishing sufficient liquidity within the stablecoin ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction** Driving down transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Last Mile Solutions** Developing effective "last mile" delivery mechanisms to ensure widespread usability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Impact on Traditional Payment Systems

Traditional payment services, such as Wise, operate within a system that is often capital inefficient and requires extensive interconnectivity and operational ties with the traditional banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These complexities could be significantly reduced or eliminated if transactions were conducted on [[infrastructure required for stablecoin payments|stablecoin rails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The potential exists for traditional players to either adopt [[Emerging stablecoin technology and blockchain design|stablecoin technology]] or face displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The [[Growth and utility of stablecoin market|SMB market]], which accounts for roughly 40% of the total payments volume, stands to benefit significantly from [[Stablecoins and their significance in fintech|stablecoins]] and their dedicated rails once these infrastructure issues are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The development of hardware consistently precedes and enables revolutions in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This relationship is considered almost a definitional point in technological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Hardware as a Prerequisite for Software Innovation
Significant software advancements and the emergence of new industries are fundamentally dependent on prior breakthroughs in [[hardware_and_software_revolutions | hardware]]. This includes:

*   **Mobile Ecosystems**: The creation of software platforms like the App Store, which facilitated the rise of major companies such as Uber, necessitated the prior existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The iPhone itself was built upon two decades of advancements in hardware from companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom, as well as the establishment of extensive network and communications technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This entire foundation was primarily on the hardware level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Deep Learning**: The proliferation of deep learning algorithms and applications required the prior development and progress of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) over a period of 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This illustrates [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | the essential role of specialized hardware in AI advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

*   **Cloud Computing**: The foundation of cloud computing relies on the availability of very cheap [[commoditization_of_hardware_technologies | commodity hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The concept of cloud computing involves aggregating inexpensive commodity hardware in a centralized location, upon which distributed systems and algorithms operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These software layers are designed to manage hardware failures in a fault-tolerant manner, providing a significant cost advantage over self-hosting hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This model was only possible after more than 20 years of continuous development in memory and CPU technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically adopted a cautious, and at times, antagonistic stance towards the crypto industry. However, under a new administration and leadership, the SEC's approach to digital assets, including [[role of meme coins in the crypto market | meme coins]] and token offerings, is shifting towards a more collaborative and transparent framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Hester Peirce and the Crypto Task Force

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as "crypto mom" for her public dissent against the SEC's rejection of a Bitcoin ETF in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, has been appointed to lead the SEC's crypto task force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This task force, formed on January 21st, is primarily composed of SEC staff who have long considered these issues, with some external expertise being brought in, such as Landon Zinda from Coin Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

The task force aims to change the SEC's previous "enforcement first" approach to one that encourages disclosure and addresses information asymmetries in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Peirce emphasizes a desire to work constructively with the industry and invites public input through crypto.sec.gov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

## Key Changes and Initiatives

### Rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121)
One of the immediate actions taken by the crypto task force was the repeal of SAB 121 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This staff accounting bulletin had previously limited the scope of traditional custodians willing to hold crypto assets due to its severe accounting consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The rescission is expected to open the door for more participants in the crypto custody space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Peirce highlighted the importance of transparent and universally applicable guidance, rather than opaque bulletins or speeches, in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Retroactive Relief for Token Offerings
The task force is considering recommending commission action to provide temporary, prospective, and retroactive relief for coin or token offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This would allow issuing entities to provide specified, updated information and agree not to contest the SEC's jurisdiction in fraud cases, thereby gaining comfort in providing disclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. The goal is to address existing information asymmetries and provide a "runway" for projects to achieve more dispersed control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This initiative aims to bridge the gap until potential legislation from Congress is passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### No-Action Letters
The SEC staff is now welcoming requests for no-action letters, which provide comfort that the staff will not recommend an enforcement action if certain circumstances are followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. This mechanism aims to provide a quick indication of the staff's thinking, particularly for projects that believe their tokens fall outside the SEC's jurisdiction, like certain utility tokens or NFTs (e.g., the Flyfish Club case) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

### Investor Accreditation Laws
The SEC is likely to focus on capital formation issues, particularly allowing access to private markets for non-accredited investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. While the crypto task force's direct remit may not cover all aspects of investor accreditation laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>, existing mechanisms like Regulation A (Reg A) and Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) could be useful for crypto projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. Peirce views the current wealth/income-based accreditation as "un-American" and problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>, suggesting alternative thresholds like educational qualifications or tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

## Regulatory Stance on Meme Coins and Airdrops

### [[The ethical and market implications of meme coins | Meme Coins]]
Peirce cautions against assuming automatic SEC jurisdiction or a regulatory backstop for [[role of the sec and future of crypto regulations | meme coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. She emphasizes that people can spend their money as they wish, but they should not expect a government agency to set rules for everything or to make them whole if prices fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. The applicability of SEC jurisdiction depends on "facts and circumstances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.

### Airdrops
The SEC is thinking about providing guidance around airdrops for U.S. citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. However, a blanket statement cannot be made, as the implications depend on the "facts and circumstances" of the airdrop and what is being airdropped (e.g., a stock versus something else) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. The SEC encourages individuals to submit generic scenarios for guidance to crypto.sec.gov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

## Securities vs. Commodities and Enforcement Actions

While acknowledging the "hairball collection" of existing enforcement actions against crypto entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>, Peirce states that each case must be assessed on its own facts and circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. She notes that past "enforcement first" policy can hinder the development of new policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.

There is optimism for improved collaboration between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the new leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. The aim is to establish jurisdiction where it makes the most sense, whether with the SEC, CFTC, FTC, or state regulators, with Congress ultimately making the determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

Regarding whether a crypto token can be labeled a security and still function effectively, Peirce acknowledges that traditional equity and debt securities will likely find their way onto blockchains and interact fine with securities laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. However, she questions whether widely participatory networks, especially those with peer-to-peer token movements, would neatly fit into the existing securities laws framework, as it might contradict the decentralized nature they aim to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

## Looking Forward

The crypto task force has many areas to work on, including broker-dealer and investment advisor custody, decentralized finance (DeFi), and Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. A key priority is to address fundamental questions about whether particular assets are covered by the SEC's jurisdiction early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

The overall goal is to build a regulatory regime that supports innovation and allows people to experiment, ensuring the process is not so difficult that only large financial companies can participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This shift aims to create a system where builders can focus on developing new things without undue legal burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

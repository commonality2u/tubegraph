The evolving landscape of blockchain and [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] infrastructure is rapidly advancing, transforming how global finance operates. [[The rise and significance of stablecoins in the global economy | Stablecoins]] are no longer merely conceptual, but an undeniable force in the financial world, compelling [[Impact of stablecoins on traditional financial systems and fintech | fintech]] and payment companies to [[The future of stablecoins and implications for global finance | future-proof their businesses]] or risk obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Rise and Significance of Stablecoins
The concept of [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] has existed since the early days of crypto, with discussions dating back to Bitcoin talk forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. By 2025, [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | stablecoins]] like [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | USDC]] and [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | Tether]] have matured into a $200 billion market cap asset class, supported by blockchain performance capable of handling internet-based [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] settlement networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This utility has driven significant progress in the last year, with cross-border [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] volumes experiencing 30% month-over-month growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This growth, combined with increasing [[regulatory_developments_and_challenges_for_stablecoins | regulatory clarity]] and [[stablecoin_regulation_and_legislation_in_the_us | stablecoin bills]] in the United States Congress, has ignited a "gold rush" in the [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] industry inherently fosters interconnectedness, as blockchain networks transcend national borders, integrating global financial rails more tightly than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Diverse Functions of Stablecoins
Not all assets labeled "[[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]]" serve the same purpose. While some, like [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | Circle]] and [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | Tether]], are primarily "payment [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]]" backed by treasuries and designed for transactional use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, others are better suited for:
*   **Collateral mobility**: Products like [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | Athena]] or [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | MakerDAO's DAI]] that are yield-bearing and can be used in treasury operations or as savings vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Tokenized deposits**: Banks like Citi are exploring tokenized deposit products that function similarly to [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] but with different backing mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

These different "flavors" of [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] serve distinct, yet sometimes overlapping, use cases, from cross-border payments and payouts to providing US dollar access in emerging markets, collateral for trading, and atomic settlement across assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Current State of Stablecoin Development
The journey of [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] can be conceptualized as stops on a train.

### Stop 1: Stablecoin Issuance
The first stop involves the creation of the [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] itself. [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | Tether]] and [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | Circle]] currently dominate this space with over $230 billion outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Historically, these were primarily used as trading pairs on centralized and decentralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

Despite their current dominance, there's a strong belief that the market for new, valuable [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] constructions is only about 5% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. This suggests significant room for innovation beyond existing models like [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | Tether]] and [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | Circle]].

#### Challenges for Incumbents
*   **Tether**: Dominant in emerging markets, but faces compliance challenges in the US and Europe under new regulations like the Genius Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Its CEO predicts a decline in market share from 70% to 35-40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **Circle**: Hamstrung by its distribution deal with Coinbase, which significantly impacts its margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. The deal mandates Circle to give 100% of surplus revenue from [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | USDC]] on Coinbase to Coinbase, and 50% of other revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>. This lack of neutrality hinders its expansion into alternative distribution models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

These challenges open opportunities for challengers and non-US dollar [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] as the market expands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

### Stop 2: Payment Infrastructure
The next crucial phase involves building out the [[challenges_and_infrastructure_needs_for_stablecoin_adoption | infrastructure]] for [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] payments. While the [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] market is already doing $50 billion a month in cross-border payments, this is a fraction of the $200 trillion annual cross-border payments market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. This sector requires solving [[challenges_and_infrastructure_needs_for_stablecoin_adoption | infrastructure problems]] related to:
*   Compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>
*   Liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>
*   Last-mile solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>

This vast addressable market (e.g., Wise's estimated $50 trillion TAM) could be significantly better served by [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] rails, which eliminate the need for extensive banking system connectivity and operational overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### Key Infrastructure Components:
Rob Haddock identifies several critical categories in the [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] payment stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>:

*   **Settlement Rails (Blockchain Layer)**: The foundational layer for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. There's an ongoing debate about whether general-purpose blockchains can meet the high throughput, privacy, and prioritization needs of large-scale traditional businesses for trillions of dollars in payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Some argue for specific chains optimized for payments that address issues like:
    *   Transaction prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>
    *   Privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>
    *   Resistance to network congestion from memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>

*   **Orchestration Layers**: Players like Bridge and Conduit connect different ramps and counterparties via APIs to facilitate [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. These layers solve challenges such as:
    *   Finding liquidity for different FX pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>
    *   Connecting the right on/off-ramps in specific locations (e.g., US to Mexico remittances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>
    *   Bridging the gap between decentralized public blockchains and the traditional, siloed financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>

    For instance, a company can facilitate a payment from Brazilian Real to Euro using Pix (Brazilian real-time payment system), swapping to a [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | stablecoin]] on-chain, and then using SEPA Instant to deposit into a European bank account, all through one API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. This process takes less than 15 minutes, compared to two weeks for traditional banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

*   **Liquidity Providers**: Essential for efficient currency conversion and transaction execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.
*   **Value Transfer and Money Services**: Services that handle the movement and management of [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   **Aggregated APIs**: Simplify integration for businesses, similar to how Stripe revolutionized e-commerce payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Messaging Platforms**: Facilitate communication within the payment network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
*   **Merchant Gateways and Ramps**: On-ramps and off-ramps to convert between fiat and [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin-powered Fintechs and Applications**: End-user applications that leverage [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] for various financial services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

#### The Importance of "Hard Things"
Success in building [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] [[challenges_and_infrastructure_needs_for_stablecoin_adoption | infrastructure]] lies in tackling the "hard things" that incumbents often avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>:
*   **Dealing with Banks**: Establishing relationships and navigating their operational and compliance requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
*   **Compliance (KYB/AML)**: Payments are expensive primarily due to compliance and risk. Isolating and underwriting risk in an atomically settling asset is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.
*   **Fronting Risk**: Managing capital efficiency and risk exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.

Companies that merely offer API wrappers without deep engagement in these areas are likely to be superseded by more vertically integrated solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.

## Evolution of Blockchain Design for Stablecoins
The first era of [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] growth was driven by native DeFi usage, where they facilitated lending, borrowing, and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. Blockchains like Solana, despite lower total [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] supply, demonstrate high transaction volume, aligning with their architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

However, public blockchains often have constraints that hinder their optimization for large-scale payment networks, such as:
*   Lack of transaction prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>
*   No privacy at the blockchain layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>
*   Vulnerability to network congestion from other activities (e.g., memecoins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>
*   Inability to pay gas fees in [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>

This has led to the emergence of [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | stablecoin]]-specific blockchains, or "app chains," which may be Layer 2s or dedicated Layer 1s that make significant trade-offs (e.g., permissioned validator sets, layer 1 privacy) to optimize for maximum throughput and [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]]-specific uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. These designs aim to compete directly with traditional payment giants like Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.

### Dedicated Payment Chains
Businesses prioritizing trillions of dollars in capital flow value liquidity, pricing, application sets, privacy, and predictable transaction times over ideological blockchain principles like decentralization or permissionlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. While general-purpose chains like Solana benefit from existing DeFi ecosystems and liquidity, they lack the specific features required by traditional finance for large-scale operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.

New projects like Codeex are building Layer 2 solutions that integrate the chain level with the application layer to create full-stack solutions optimized for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>. The challenge for these new chains is acquiring initial flow, and a key strategy involves offering centralized services and excellent customer support, as exemplified by Solana's success with PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

However, completely closed systems are unlikely to succeed, as they would be outcompeted by existing players like Visa, who are also exploring tokenized payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. The ideal approach is to build on a permissionless stack that prioritizes regulated B2B transactions but allows for interoperability and different use cases as risk tolerance evolves over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

## Implications for Traditional Finance
The increasing adoption of [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] has significant implications for traditional financial systems:

*   **Banks**: Traditional banks are slow to innovate and face challenges in adapting their tech stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. While domestic real-time payment networks may still compete on speed and cost for local transactions, the global macro environment, with rising protectionism and ineffective cross-border banking, favors the shift to [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.
*   **Emerging Markets**: Countries with inflating local currencies or a strong demand for US dollars are increasingly adopting [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>. [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | Stablecoins]] offer regulatory arbitrage, allowing users to avoid taxes on foreign currency transactions, which is a boon for young populations seeking access to US dollar goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>. This trend could lead to a decline in the number of actively used currencies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>.
*   **Non-US Dollar Stablecoins**: While necessary for foreign exchange and specific transactions (e.g., trade finance), non-US dollar [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] are not expected to achieve significant market cap or widespread holding on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. They will primarily function as utility tokens, facilitating connections between local economies and the predominantly dollar-denominated [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.

The future will likely see consolidation within the [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] space, with traditional fintech and payment companies acquiring orchestration layers and last-mile providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This will lead to a vertical integration where entities like Stripe might issue their own [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] or RWAs as part of their treasury products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>. Most standalone [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] fintech apps are expected to struggle due to distribution challenges against established players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.

## The Future of Stablecoins
The proliferation of [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. While many entities will attempt to issue their own, the market will likely consolidate to 5-10 dominant US dollar [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] that achieve real scale in traditional payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>. Interoperability will become key, as many will use the same backend service providers despite distinct branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.

> "If [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] are an inevitability at this point, and if you are building in [[Impact of stablecoins on traditional financial systems and fintech | fintech]] and or at a payment company and you aren't actively figuring out how do I [[the_future_of_stablecoins_and_implications_for_global_finance | future-proof]] this business for [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]], you're going to lose." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>

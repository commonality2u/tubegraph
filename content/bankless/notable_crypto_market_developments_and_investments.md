This article covers the weekly news, drama, and developments in the crypto space for the fourth week of January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, featuring insights from Eric Connor, a "crypto AI bull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Crypto Market Overview

The overall [[Crypto market trends and token movements | crypto market]] experienced significant inflows and notable price movements across major assets.

### Bitcoin and Ethereum Performance
Bitcoin started the week at $111,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> and was up 5% to $114,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. It broke its all-time high midweek, reaching over $108,000 per coin, possibly touching $109,000 on some exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Eric Connor notes that the Bitcoin graph looks strong with a powerful narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. If Bitcoin can turn $100,000 into support, it's likely to climb further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

In contrast, Ether (ETH) was down 3% on the week, closing at $3,200 after starting at $3,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This divergence from Bitcoin's performance is unusual, as they typically move in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Ethereum has been "stuck" in a $3,000-$4,000 range, with $4,000 serving as brutal resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars flowing into Ether ETFs, its price remains stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Market Inflows
The [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | crypto industry]] saw gargantuan US dollar inflows, with $2.2 billion flowing into digital assets over the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Bitcoin ETFs alone received substantial inflows: $250 million on January 22nd, $800 million the day before, and over $1 billion on January 17th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Ether ETFs also experienced positive inflows for nearly 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The total crypto market cap reached $3.7 trillion, nearing its all-time high of $3.9 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Donald Trump's Impact on Crypto
Donald Trump's recent actions and statements have significantly influenced the crypto space.

### The "Trump Memecoin"
A new "official Trump meme" coin was launched, tweeting from Donald Trump's official Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The website "gettrumpmemes.com" facilitated purchases via debit card or crypto on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The token, named "official Trump," debuted with a market cap of around $1-2 billion (with a $10 billion fully diluted valuation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a> and soared from $2 to $28 in half a day, adding $50 billion to its market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. 80% of the token supply is locked up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

Eric Connor noted that this event was "fascinating" as it involved the President of the United States launching a memecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The release of a "Melania coin" subsequently caused the Trump memecoin to dump by 55%, from $75 down to $32, effectively killing its momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Despite the dump, the "official Trump" coin still clocks in at $37 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

This memecoin launch led to a "historic retail onboarding event" on Solana:
*   50% of Trump and Melania holders had never bought a Solana altcoin before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
*   47% of buyers created their wallets the same day they purchased the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
*   83% of holders owned less than $1,000 of Solana assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

Solana search terms in Google are now three times higher than their 2021 peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Eric Connor believes this is bullish for the crypto industry, normalizing presidents launching memecoins and reducing regulatory fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### Trump's DeFi Project and ETH Staking
Donald Trump's DeFi project, "World Liberty Financial," a fork deployed on Scroll and Ethereum Layer 2, announced strategic purchases to commemorate his inauguration as the 47th president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. This included $47 million in ETH, $47 million in wrapped Bitcoin, and $4.7 million in Chainlink (LINK), Tron (TRX), and Athena (ARB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. Donald Trump's entities are also staking ETH; a picture from Etherscan shows $15 million of ETH staked to the World Liberty Financial multisig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

### Pardon of Ross Ulbricht
Donald Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>, who had been in jail for almost 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. The pardon was in honor of Ulbricht's mother, Lyn Ulbricht, and the libertarian movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Kraken exchange donated $111,000 in Bitcoin to Ross Ulbricht to help him get back on his feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. This act is seen as a testament to the growing power of Bitcoin and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

## Regulatory Shifts and Clarity
The crypto industry is seeing a significant shift in its regulatory landscape.

### Gary Gensler's Departure and New Leadership
Gary Gensler's final day at the SEC was marked by a statement from Commissioners Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, and Mark Uyeda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. Mark Uyeda, a pro-crypto commissioner, was named acting chair of the SEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. Similarly, Caroline Pham, also pro-crypto, was named acting chairman of the CFTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

### SEC Crypto 2.0 Task Force
Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda announced the formation of a new crypto task force headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. This initiative aims to re-evaluate past SEC enforcement actions and litigations related to crypto, providing much-needed clear guidance and framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Eric Connor states that this is great for crypto, ending the intentional murkiness of previous regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

### Industry Leaders' Perspectives
Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, expressed hope for regulatory clarity from the "most pro-crypto Congress ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. He emphasized the need for the SEC and CFTC to collaborate on rulemaking to define which assets are commodities and which are securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. Armstrong also believes that "every project, every individual, every meme on the Internet is going to have one of these [tokens]," leading to millions of tokens in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, wants the SEC to "rapidly approve the tokenization of bonds and stocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. This sentiment reflects a broader industry desire to tokenize all assets.

### Legislative and Institutional Adoption
Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known Bitcoiner, was announced to chair the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>. Her home state of Wyoming has also proposed a bill for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. The CEO of Bank of America stated that the financial industry is ready to adopt crypto payments if regulators provide the "green light," likely referring to the FIT21 bill currently moving through the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

### Tornado Cash Sanctions Lifted
OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash were lifted by a US court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. This decision, influenced by a legal challenge sponsored by Coinbase, is seen as a significant win for privacy in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>, though it does not yet clear Roman Storm, one of its founders, from his independent legal case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

## Ethereum Foundation Drama
There has been significant tension over the role and direction of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Vitalik Buterin tweeted about "large changes to Ethereum Foundation leadership structure" that have been ongoing for almost a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. Goals include improving technical expertise, communication, talent acquisition, application builder support, and using decentralized/privacy tech on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

Vitalik clarified that the EF would *not* undertake an ideological shift, aggressively lobby regulators, risk Ethereum's neutrality, or become an arena for vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. He also stated that individuals seeking a different vision are welcome to start their own organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.

Eric Connor, who has advocated for EF changes for years, highlighted the lack of transparency and opaqueness within the EF as a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. He argues that the EF, with its billion-dollar treasury, is "vitally important" and cannot simply be dismissed with the suggestion to "start your own Foundation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

The core tension lies between Vitalik's vision of the EF as a non-profit promoting values and frontier research, and the community's desire for a more top-down, market-competitive organization that guides Ethereum's development and addresses current user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. This includes a call for figures like Danny Ryan to take on executive roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. There is a disconnect between the EF's "utopian vision" and what users are actually doing on the chain, such as using memecoins and DeFi speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

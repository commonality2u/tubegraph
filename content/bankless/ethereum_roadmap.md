A significant discussion revolves around whether the current focus on scaling Layer 1 (L1) on the [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | Ethereum roadmap]] represents a "pivot" or merely a "reprioritization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Arguments for a "Pivot"

The argument for a pivot is that scaling the L1 did not appear to be a priority three months, six months, or certainly a year ago, making its current prominence a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Hazu's commentary supports the idea that while scaling the Layer 1 was always on the long-term [[ethereum_development_priorities | roadmap]] for [[Ethereums roadmap towards institutional adoption | Ethereum]], it has now been brought to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This shift is described as an "ego thing" by some, where there's a reluctance to admit past shortcomings or changes in direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. It is considered beneficial to admit when things were "wrong" and to make them "right," which is what the market desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Arguments Against a "Pivot"

Anthony Cisano contends that it is not a pivot, stating that scaling the L1 was always an integral part of the [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | roadmap]], encompassing stages like Merge, Surge, Scourge, Verge, and Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The counter-argument is that admitting it was "always on the [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | roadmap]]" allows for "saving face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

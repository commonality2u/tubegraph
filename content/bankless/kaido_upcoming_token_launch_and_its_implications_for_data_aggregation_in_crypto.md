Kaido is a platform focused on tracking [[emerging_trends_and_companies_in_ai_crypto | emerging trends]] and developments within the [[crypto_ai_sector_developments | AI crypto space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It offers tools like a "heat map" to visualize top narratives and discussions across crypto Twitter over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

## Current Functionality

Kaidoâ€™s platform aggregates and curates information, helping users identify valuable "alpha" within the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. Key features include:
*   **Narrative Heat Map**: Shows the most talked-about topics, with [[AI developments in crypto | AI]] consistently being a leading narrative for over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
*   **Content Curation**: Algorithms help identify and filter out useful information from influential content creators on Twitter, distinguishing them from spam or low-value content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.
*   **Data Aggregation**: Beyond Twitter, Kaido pulls data from various sources like governance forums, proposals, vote counts, and podcast transcripts, providing a comprehensive overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.
*   **AI-Powered Platform**: Kaido utilizes AI algorithms to serve up and decide which data or stories to present to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **API Access**: Many builders implement Kaido's APIs into their [[AI developments in crypto | AI agents]] to access high-quality data, which is crucial for the performance of [[AI developments in crypto | AI models]] and [[AI developments in crypto | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

## The Kaito Token Launch

Kaido is launching its native token, Kaito (KAI T O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. This launch is highly anticipated, with speculation comparing it to the Hyperliquid launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

The token is expected to be integral to a new initiative called "InfoFi" or "Info Finance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

## Vision for Data Aggregation

With the Kaito token, Kaido aims to scale its data aggregation capabilities in a massive, open-source way, positioning itself as the "data layer for the attention economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. Its ambition is to become "the Google for crypto," providing a decentralized platform for querying data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

### "Grocery Store for AI Agents"
The vision is for Kaido to become a "grocery store for [[AI developments in crypto | AI agents]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. [[AI developments in crypto | Agents]] needing specific data to perform tasks could utilize Kaito tokens to access this data, thereby improving their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.

## Impact on Information Quality

Kaido seeks to counteract the decline in signal quality on platforms like Twitter, which has been impacted by the proliferation of [[AI developments in crypto | AI]] bots and low-quality replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. By refining raw data into high-quality information using [[AI developments in crypto | AI algorithms]], Kaido aims to surface the most valuable and true information for its consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.

## Token Incentives

While specific details of the Kaito token's utility are not yet fully disclosed, it is known to include:
*   **Staking Component**: The token will have a staking mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.
*   **Prediction Markets**: A form of prediction market will allow users to determine the veracity of data and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.
*   **Reward System**: The platform intends to reward token holders for their contributions to data curation and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.

Kaido's "Yappers Campaign" rewards content creators who consistently produce high-value information with the aim of incentivizing high-quality curation of future information sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

## Ecosystem Connections

Kaido operates a subnet on [[Sovereign AI and its implications in the crypto space | BitTensor]], which has supported its development in the open-source domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This connection highlights Kaido's role in the broader ecosystem of [[Crypto AI sector developments | crypto AI sector developments]].

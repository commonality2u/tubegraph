A significant discussion point regarding [[ethereums_roadmap_and_priorities | Ethereum's roadmap and priorities]] revolves around whether recent changes constitute a "pivot" or merely a "re-prioritization" of existing [[ethereums_strategic_roadmap | strategic roadmap]] items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Debate: Pivot vs. Re-prioritization

Some observers argue that a "pivot" is justified because scaling the Layer 1 (L1) did not appear to be a priority three months, six months, or certainly a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift in focus feels like a notable change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

Conversely, figures like Anthony Cisano contend that it is not a pivot, asserting that scaling the L1 has always been an integral part of [[ethereums_roadmap_and_upgrades | Ethereum's roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This includes phases such as Merge, Surge, Scourge, Verge, and Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Hazu's Commentary on the Pivot

Hazu's perspective supports the idea that while [[ethereums_strategic_roadmap | Ethereum's 100-item roadmap]] always included scaling the L1 as a long-term goal, the current change is that this specific long-term aspect has been brought to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Hazu suggests that the reluctance to call it a "pivot" might be an "ego thing," a desire to avoid admitting fault or being wrong, instead opting to "save face" by stating it was always on the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This approach is considered damaging, as it is beneficial and acceptable to admit when things were not perfectly aligned and to change course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Admitting a pivot allows for acknowledging past missteps and taking corrective action, which is what the market desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Key Takeaway
The perceived "pivot" in [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_future_potential | Ethereum's strategic pivot and future potential]] is primarily about the accelerated focus and prioritization of L1 scaling, rather than its complete absence from past [[plans_for_future_ethereum_upgrades_and_forks | future plans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

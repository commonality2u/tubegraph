Etherealize, co-founded by VC Raman and Danny Ryan, was established to bridge the gap between traditional institutions and the [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This mission involves actively engaging with Wall Street, governments, and nation-state economies to onboard them onto Ethereum's rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. While distinct, Etherealize and the [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] (EF) maintain a close, synergistic relationship aimed at advancing [[ethereums_future_strategic_direction | Ethereum's future strategic direction]] and broader adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Formal and Informal Ties

Danny Ryan, a former [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] coordinator known for leading the Merge, joined Etherealize due to its critical mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. He highlights his deep relationships with EF personnel developed over nearly eight years at the foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

The initial funding for Etherealize came from a grant from the EF and Vitalik Buterin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This grant served as a signal of legitimacy, particularly for Wall Street institutions looking to engage with Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. While direct formal relationships are subject to ongoing conversations, Etherealize benefits from strong communication and relationship ties with the EF, particularly in the R&D sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

Etherealize operates as a Delaware C-Corp for its for-profit activities, focusing on consulting and product development for institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. It also plans to establish a non-profit arm for R&D, policy work, and broader ecosystem marketing, which aligns with [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]]'s traditional focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Filling the Void: Aggressive Onboarding

Historically, Ethereum's commitment to credible neutrality meant it largely remained a "voiceless" protocol, not engaging in aggressive business development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This created a "vacuum" where more centralized competitors could do BD behind closed doors, potentially misrepresenting Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Etherealize's Mission
> Etherealize's mission is to fill this void by providing a voice for Ethereum in institutional settings and actively helping institutions build products and bring their assets onto Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

VC Raman, with his Wall Street background, asserts that Ethereum is already winning and is the default choice for tokenized assets, economic security, regulatory presence, and institutional adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Etherealize's role is to remind people why, and to aggressively facilitate the onboarding process now that Ethereum is "open for business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

## A New Era for Ethereum and the EF

The creation of Etherealize coincides with [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_changes | leadership changes]] within the [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]], with new co-executive directors Tomas and Shae leading the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Danny Ryan views this as a "new era" for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

Previously, the EF kept a "low tone" to foster resilience and decentralization across the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. However, the landscape has changed with competing blockchains, VCs with vested interests, and a shifting regulatory environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

Danny believes the EF can now be "more opinionated" and act as a "counterbalancing force" to powerful external forces, without taking control of the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Shae, with her deep roots in protocol research and EF philosophy, provides an anchor, while Tomas, with his business background, brings "outsider energy" and a "let's get it done" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This combination allows the EF to remain grounded while being more aggressive and decisive in communicating consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Synergistic Roles
> Etherealize and other entities are expected to "fill in the void" by actively engaging with the world, while the EF shifts to a more proactive, opinionated stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This creates a "flywheel of adoption" where Etherealize's client work fuels lobbying and R&D, while the EF's clearer voice helps meet the world head-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Etherealize and the [[ethereum_foundations_new_leadership_and_its_goals | Ethereum Foundation]] are working in parallel to ensure Ethereum seizes the opportunity to be adopted as civilizational infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. They aim to balance Ethereum's core values of neutrality and decentralization with the necessary aggression and engagement to secure its position in the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

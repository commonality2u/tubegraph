## Introduction to Layer 1 Token Valuation

Every Layer 1 (L1) blockchain features a native token, commonly referred to as an L1 token. The crucial question facing investors and analysts is how to accurately value these tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Understanding what drives returns and assessing risks is paramount for investors when dealing with any asset, including L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. A robust valuation framework provides analysts with a perspective on whether an asset is over- or undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, enabling informed comparisons between different blockchains like Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

L1 tokens constitute the vast majority of the total crypto market capitalization, which currently stands at over $3 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Bitcoin alone accounts for approximately 63% of this, with other significant L1s including Ethereum, Solana, Sui, and Bit Tensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The value of applications built on these platforms is "levered to the value that these sort of base layers are accruing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The question of [[Impact of Market Valuations and Crypto Assets | how to value cryptocurrencies]] is literally "the trillion dollar question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, as traditional valuation methods often don't fully apply due to unique crypto variables and dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Historical and Prevailing Valuation Approaches

Historically, various methods have been attempted to value L1 tokens:

### Quantity Theory of Money (MV=PQ)
This monetary theory centers the valuation of money on its velocity (rate of spending), positing that money supply times velocity must equal price times output (nominal GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Popular around 2016-2017, this method has largely fallen out of favor for valuing L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Stock-to-Flow
Popularized by Bitcoiners, this model assumes that scarcity, measured by the ratio of existing supply to annual issuance, directly drives value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. While comparable to gold's demand-supply dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, its limitation lies in assuming "infinite persistent demand" and being solely supply-side focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. It has not "held up so well" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Relative Valuation (Gold Analogy)
A more recent approach involves comparing Bitcoin to the total addressable market (TAM) of gold (around $18 trillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The idea is to estimate what percentage of this non-nation state store of value Bitcoin can capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Bitcoin bulls often argue that the digital version should eventually exceed the analog version's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This line of thinking can be extended to other L1 assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Current Consensus (as of May 2025)
The prevailing consensus among analysts is that Bitcoin is a "special snowflake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, valued similar to gold as a monetary store of value. However, all other L1 assets are generally thought to be valued differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Real Economic Value (REV) and its Critique

### Definition of REV
[[Real Economic Value REV in Cryptocurrency | Real Economic Value (REV)]] is a metric that measures "how much fees users are paying to L1 validators or how much value those validators are capturing from transaction activity on the chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. It's a "naturally pure metric" that reflects the total dollar value paid by users for blockchain transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Model with REV
Some analysts interpret REV as "company cash flows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, using it to feed a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value L1 tokens like companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. A DCF model determines the present value of an asset as the sum of all future cash flows, discounted by a rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This method is sound for traditional companies that compound a balance sheet of non-native currencies (e.g., Apple collecting fiat currency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### Critiques of Using DCF/REV for L1 Tokens
1.  **Circular Reference**: The primary issue is that L1 tokens are not company shares and do not accrue value like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Validators are not paid in a non-native currency (like USDC); they earn more of the native token (e.g., ETH or SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This creates a "very circular reference" where the value derived is just more of the same token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. You need a "non-circular fundamental driver to measure so that you can value this asset in dollar terms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Intrinsic Valuation**: Valuing an L1 token using REV as a DCF for validator-captured value is akin to valuing Apple based on how many Apple shares it collected from its own users; it's "not an intrinsic valuation metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
3.  **Metcalfe's Law (Network Effect)**: If one entity owned the entire supply of an L1 token (ETH, SOL, BTC), its value would be zero because there would be no one else to pay fees or conduct transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This highlights that L1 tokens are network assets, and their value depends on broad participation, not just internal cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. This concept aligns with Metcalfe's Law, similar to a telephone network where a single owner makes the network valueless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
4.  **Fee Compression**: While REV provides a "great snapshot window into the current demand to use a blockchain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, it primarily measures the demand to use the L1 token for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. As blockchains scale rapidly (e.g., Ethereum's block space potentially 100x-ing with ZK-rollups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>, the cost of transactions (fees) "continues to deflate at that rate of scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>, negating much of the value accrual from payments growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. Fees are expected to trend towards zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
    *   *Nuance on Fee Compression*: While data availability (DA) fees may compress, "transaction ordering" (priority fees for faster inclusion) might be a "durable driver of REV" due to a fundamental limit on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. However, even these yields are expected to compress over time as demand for non-government money increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.

### REV's Importance in Crypto's Evolution
Despite its limitations for L1 valuation, REV (and DCF) are acknowledged for helping move the crypto industry "out of the dark ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, where valuations were based purely on narrative. It introduced the concept of "fundamentals" to crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. For non-L1 assets (e.g., DeFi protocols like Aave or Pendle), DCF models are still considered sound because these assets generate revenue in non-native currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

## Realized Store of Value (RSOV): A New Framework

The core thesis is that L1 tokens are money, not stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

### Defining Money and L1 Tokens as Money
Money is "any asset that's primarily used to make payments and as a store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **Payments**: L1 tokens are used for payments for on-chain services and goods (e.g., transactions on Ethereum are paid in ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **Store of Value**: L1 tokens are used as a store of value, primarily through staking (taking duration risk for yield) and as deposit assets in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
This usage demonstrates that L1 tokens fit the precise definition of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. They act as "commodity money" with network properties, sitting between nation-state fiat and traditional commodities like gold or copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. It is the actual usage that defines them as money, not just a declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

### Store of Value as the Primary Driver
While L1 tokens are used for payments, the "vast bulk of value created is more on the store of value use case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Store of Value (SoV)**: This involves holding wealth across time, similar to how the U.S. Dollar functions as a world reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. For L1 tokens, the supply inflation is typically very low (e.g., ETH at max +2% annually, potentially deflationary when staked), meaning demand growth is not met with significant supply growth, leading to price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Payments**: The supply of blockspace (the thing being purchased for payments) is rapidly expanding due to scaling solutions, which compresses fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. Therefore, the payments use case is largely discounted when valuing L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

### Defining Realized Store of Value (RSOV)
[[Fundamentals and Crypto Valuation Techniques | RSOV]] is a metric that tracks the two primary drivers of store of value demand for L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>:
1.  **Realized value of L1 tokens staked**: This measures the aggregate dollar value of tokens currently locked in staking, reflecting long-term conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.
2.  **Realized value of L1 tokens in DeFi**: This measures the aggregate dollar value of tokens deposited into DeFi protocols (e.g., as collateral, for liquidity), indicating their use as a monetary asset within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

RSOV is inspired by Bitcoin's "realized cap" metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>, which represents the aggregate cost basis of the entire network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. RSOV is an adapted version for smart contract platforms, measuring the aggregate cost basis of tokens specifically held for staking and DeFi use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.

### How RSOV Captures Value
When users buy and stake ETH at a certain price (e.g., $5,000), or deposit it into DeFi protocols (like Aave, MakerDAO, Uniswap), it increases the RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>. This signifies "a bunch of money came in to buy a bunch of ETH and hold it for a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. The RSOV *only* increases when there are "actual like real onchain transactions, real inflows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a> and is not simply affected by future price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>.

RSOV elegantly captures REV because when users transact and pay fees in the native token, and validators hold/compound these fees, the realized value of the staked token increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. Thus, "Rev grows RSOV one block at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. High REV indicates a faster transfer of the L1 asset from "spenders to savers" (stakers), which then contributes to RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>.

## RSOV in Practice and Implications

### RSOV vs. Market Cap
The difference between an L1 token's market cap and its RSOV represents the "future growth effectively that the market has currently priced in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. For example, if Ethereum's RSOV is $120 billion and its market cap is $350 billion, the $230 billion gap indicates anticipated future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

### Comparing RSOV Ratios
Analyzing the Price-to-RSOV ratio across various L1s (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, Ton, Sui) reveals market expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>. A very high ratio, such as Sui's 185x, suggests that the market cap is significantly higher than the actual on-chain store of value usage, implying "a lot of future growth priced in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This is akin to high multiples in a DCF model, assuming substantial growth in cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>.

### Drivers of RSOV Growth
Factors that help increase RSOV for an L1 token include:
*   **Inflows into staking**: Driven by higher staking yields or a positive change in market perception, leading to more demand for the yield (lower perceived risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
*   **Inflows into DeFi**: More usage of the L1 asset as a deposit asset for collateral or liquidity, incentivized by higher yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.
*   **Growing asset issuance across the network**: More digital assets (stablecoins, tokenized BTC) available on-chain for pairing with the L1 token in DeFi pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.
*   **Strong Monetary Attributes**: Reliable issuance policy, hardened protocol rules, and an easy-to-verify chain that highlights the strengths of digital crypto money relative to analog government money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>. These make the asset a more credible store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

### L1s as Commodities
L1 tokens are fundamentally commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. Traditional investors are familiar with valuing commodities (like gold or oil) which cannot be valued using DCF models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:58">[01:33:58]</a>. The value of L1 tokens is derived from their usage as money, specifically the aggregate inflows from people selling other currencies (e.g., dollars) to buy and hold them long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

### The [[The concept and implications of a crypto strategic reserve | L2]] Debate: Parasitic vs. Synergistic
The debate on whether Layer 2s are parasitic or synergistic to L1s is largely a "discounted cash flow REV type debate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>.
*   Early L2s might have displaced L1 sequencing, compressing L1 staking yields (a REV-centric view) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.
*   However, from an RSOV perspective, L2s are synergistic because they enable more people to buy and use the L1 token in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. Whether the L1 token is used on the L1 or L2 (e.g., ETH on Base or Arbitrum) for DeFi, it still contributes to the realized value of the token, increasing RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>. A higher staking yield combined with the ability to onboard new capital through L2s leads to increased inflows and thus increased RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>.

### [[Role of Regulation in the Crypto Industry | Censorship Risk]]
The ability of an L1's validators to censor transactions (e.g., Sui validators freezing hacker's funds) does not mean the L1 token ceases to be money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:46">[01:27:46]</a>. It merely suggests it might be "not very good money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a> and could lead to a decrease in RSOV as users choose to store value in less censorable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. This parallels nation-state censorship of fiat holdings (e.g., Russia's assets by the U.S.), which can lead to shifts in strategic reserves (e.g., China selling U.S. treasuries for gold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:35">[01:26:35]</a>.

### Tribal Dynamics in Valuation
There are differing views within crypto:
*   **Bitcoin Maxis**: Often prefer stripping utility from the blockchain (e.g., [[Bitcoins OPRETURN debate and implications | Bitcoin's OP_RETURN debate]]), desiring near 100% RSOV emphasis and minimal cash flows, believing any revenue dilutes the monetary base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>.
*   **REV/DCF Advocates**: Found further down the market cap stack, they emphasize revenue generation and demand for block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.
*   **Ethereum's "Both" Approach**: Ethereum aims to be both a store of value and generate fees (via burning), which can "tie a knot in people's brains" who prefer simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. The burn (from fees) is good for RSOV, and RSOV is good for the burn, creating a synergistic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>.

## Total Addressable Market (TAM) for Digital Non-Sovereign Money

Viewing L1 tokens as money opens up an exciting [[Impact of Market Valuations and Crypto Assets | Total Addressable Market (TAM)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
Comparing digital crypto money (Bitcoin, ETH, SOL, TAO) to analog and government-based money (gold, USD, Euro, CNY), the potential upside is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   Analog/Government Base Money: ~$45 trillion (gold at $19T, USD at $5.6T, Euro at $5.3T, CNY at $5.1T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.
*   Digital Crypto Money: ~$2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
This represents a potential "20x upside" even with a conservative view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. The market is increasingly likely to view these digital crypto monies as credible stores of value, especially as traditional fiat systems face crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. The digital disruptor typically becomes larger than the analog incumbent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>.

Analysts who push for DCF or REV as the primary metric for L1s might be considered "bearish" because they "miss the forest in the trees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a>, overlooking the much larger TAM for digital money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:37">[01:41:37]</a>. All L1 tokens "accrue value in the same way" as money, meaning those with lower RSOV ratios (like Ethereum) present significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:53">[01:42:53]</a>. Bitcoin acts as a "Trojan horse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>, paving the way for non-government money demand, and other crypto assets will follow as they mature and demonstrate similar monetary attributes (e.g., programmatic, transparent, autonomous, 24/7 liquid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Future of RSOV and [[Investor strategies in the crypto market | Investor Implications]]

RSOV is presented as a "V1 version" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">[01:34:27]</a>, with hopes for future improvements. Analysts are encouraged to identify other measurable store of value usages (e.g., ETF inflows) to refine the framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[01:34:57]</a>. Data providers are also called upon to improve the quality and accessibility of the data needed to track RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:27">[01:36:27]</a>.

Skycatcher, an investment firm focused on bespoke opportunities at the internet frontier, employs a chain-agnostic, data-driven, and fundamental-focused approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>. Their [[Investor strategies in the crypto market | crypto investment strategy]] includes valuing application-layer tokens with DCF, but developed the RSOV framework specifically for L1 tokens after extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:23">[01:38:23]</a>.

From an RSOV lens, Ethereum appears "really, really undervalued" relative to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>. Its potential to surpass Bitcoin's monetary asset inflows is high due to catalysts like real-time proving, base rollups (L1 doing more work), and leadership changes focused on L1 scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>. Ethereum's strong monetary attributes (censorship resistance, low inflation) and its status as a base asset for 85% of on-chain finance further differentiate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>. This indicates that "there can be more than one snowflake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a> in the digital money landscape.

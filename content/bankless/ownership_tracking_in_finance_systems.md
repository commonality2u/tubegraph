Even before [[blockchain_and_finance | blockchain]], [[limitations_of_current_internet_finance_systems | internet finance]] existed, allowing users to access bank accounts online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, this online access primarily serves as a communication layer rather than the direct medium for transactions or ownership records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Role of the Internet in Current Finance

The internet's function in contemporary [[legal_and_financial_systems | finance]] is likened to GrubHub for pizza delivery: the order is communicated online, but the actual product (pizza) is made in an analog shop, not on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Similarly, when a user sends a message to a bank like Wells Fargo, the bank processes the [[legal_and_financial_systems | financial transaction]] within its "permissioned silo database," which is not accessible on the open internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Thus, [[legal_and_financial_systems | finance]] primarily operates through "silo databases that communicate over the internet occasionally," with the internet serving only for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## How Ownership is Recorded

### Startup Investments
For investments in startups, ownership of equity is typically recorded on a spreadsheet maintained by the company team. This spreadsheet lists the investor's name alongside the amount of money they invested, with the ownership residing within that Excel sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Publicly Traded Stocks
When owning stocks, such as 100 shares of Apple through a platform like Robin Hood, the ownership is recorded as a database entry on Robin Hood's server (e.g., "Felipe 100 Apple") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Robin Hood then works directly with a depository trust company, which, in turn, coordinates with the issuing company (Apple) to manage these records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This system highlights that ownership is tracked internally within private, permissioned databases, with the internet acting merely as a conduit for user interaction and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The argument is made that to solidify Ethereum's position, there needs to be a strong emphasis on holding ETH, promoting it widely, and creating a positive feedback loop around its ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Promoting ETH Holding

A multi-faceted approach is recommended to encourage and celebrate the [[the_importance_of_holding_eth | holding of ETH]]:
*   **Direct Advocacy** Tell everyone you know to hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Community Incentives**
    *   Shame Layer 2s, treasuries, whales, and DAOs that do not hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
    *   Celebrate and incentivize those who do hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Active Participation** Stake, restake, and auto-stake ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Narrative Building**
    *   [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_and_meme_culture | Meme ETH]] as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
    *   Utilize various media (writing, tweeting, podcasting, shitposting) and elect leaders to spread this message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
    *   Proselytize the concept that "1 ETH = 1 ETH" until it becomes common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Nature of a Store of Value

A store of value is fundamentally built on "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This is exemplified by traditional assets like gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, both of which derive their value from "pure irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It is suggested that [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_and_meme_culture | Ethereum]], being seen as too "smart" or "ivory tower," often overlooks the critical "meme layer narrative" necessary for establishing itself as a true store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Community Approach and Necessary Shift

While the idea of "shaming" might be unpopular within parts of the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, the question is posed, "Do we want to win?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Not every member of the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] needs to adopt this aggressive stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Instead, a dedicated contingent of "ETH bulls" who are highly enthusiastic about ETH—verging on "laser eyes"—is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This does not necessitate the "Bitcoin toxicity" seen in other communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, as [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum]] already possesses an economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The key is to reorient discussions within the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] towards the ETH asset itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

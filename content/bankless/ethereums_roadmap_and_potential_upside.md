While it is "materially harder today than it was in 2021 or 2022" for Ethereum to "win" in the blockchain space, the project still possesses significant potential upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Current Challenges

Ethereum faces several challenges that have made its path more difficult:
*   **Bitcoin's Dominance:** Bitcoin has continued its growth trajectory, solidifying its branding as "digital gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It is now regarded as a "special snowflake" by the United States government, with a "strategic Bitcoin reserve" in existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Ethereum should aspire to a similar level of recognition and adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Loss of "Moneyiness":** Ether has "lost its moneyiness" and has fallen into an "inferior valuation bucket" as a smart contract Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Crowded Marketplace:** The smart contract Layer 1 space is "a very crowded marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Ethereum's ability to compete against "much more centralized, faster moving competitors" that are "willing to cut corners" is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This environment is seen as one where Ethereum is "not suited to win" and from which it "needs to get out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Shared Roadmap and Ethereum's Unique Position

Despite current challenges, Ethereum is on "the [[ethereum_roadmap|Ethereum roadmap]] that all blockchains are on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This shared direction involves building a "grand unified vision for the blockchain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Examples include Bitcoin pursuing Layer 2 solutions and Solana developing network extensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Potential Upside

Ethereum holds the "largest upside" if it can execute this shared [[ethereum_roadmap|roadmap]] "better than anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This potential is considered "inaccessible to Solana" and "inaccessible to Bitcoin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The "grand unified vision of Ethereum" represents the "largest TAM [Total Addressable Market] that exists," and the goal is to realize this potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The current intellectual property (IP) landscape highlights a significant challenge: the existing copyright system is largely [[outdated_copyright_system | outdated]] and struggles to keep pace with modern content generation on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Limitations of the Current Copyright System

Dating back to the printing press era, the traditional copyright system was well-suited for mediums like books, radio, and television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These channels operated on a top-down distribution model, where control was centralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This structure allowed for effective enforcement of royalties, such as a radio producer or music label enforcing payments for song usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Impact of the Internet

The advent of the internet fundamentally shifted content distribution to a peer-to-peer model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This change led to a proliferation of content creators and enabled content to be remixed and shared at extremely high speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Content Generation

The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) has further exacerbated the issue. AI now drives an exponential growth in content generation, with petabytes of content being created daily, potentially even per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Need for a New IP System

This unprecedented volume and speed of content creation, particularly with the [[role_of_ai_and_blockchain_in_transforming_ip_markets | role of AI]], mean that the current IP system is no longer capable of supporting the contemporary reality of content creation and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Requirements for a Modern IP System

A new IP system is necessary to address these challenges. It must be:
*   **Internet-Compatible**: Able to operate effectively at the speed of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Programmable**: Designed to allow for instantaneous registration of newly created IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Fair and Seamless**: Capable of seamlessly licensing and fairly attributing new content that is based on existing works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

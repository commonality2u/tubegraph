For approximately 30 to 40 years, progress in space exploration remained largely stalled, which has influenced public intuition about the field's potential for rapid advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Historical Stagnation

A key indicator of this stagnation was the cost per kilogram to orbit, which remained at roughly $100,000 for about 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This consistent high cost limited the scope and frequency of space missions.

## Current and Future Developments

However, recent advancements are set to drastically change this trajectory. [[SpaceX and the future of orbital transportation | SpaceX]], with its fully reusable Starship, aims to reduce the cost per kilogram to orbit to as low as $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents an astonishing 50,000x [[cost_reduction_in_space_travel | reduction in cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Beyond just cost, the [[increased_capabilities_in_space_payloads | amount of material]] that can be sent into space is also seeing a monumental increase. In the next decade, it's projected that the annual volume of material launched into space could be a million times greater than what was possible 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Analogies to Historical Transformation

The combination of a 50,000x reduction in cost and a millionfold increase in payload capacity is unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The most fitting historical [[comparison_of_space_developments_to_the_railroad_era | analogy]] for this transformation is the early railroad era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This period saw a shift from hazardous, slow horse-drawn carriage travel across America to comfortable, cheap, and efficient transport of vast quantities of goods and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This transition from "horse-drawn carriages to space" to "railroad space" signifies a fundamental change in accessibility and capability for space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

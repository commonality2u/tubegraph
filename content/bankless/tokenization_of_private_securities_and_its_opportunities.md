[[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | Tokenization]], defined as taking a non-cryptonative asset and representing it on a blockchain for free tradability, presents significant opportunities for private securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has made the case for [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | tokenizing]] private securities, suggesting it could benefit both companies and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Current Challenges for Private Investment
Currently, it is difficult for average investors to invest in private companies such as OpenAI or SpaceX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While equity does change hands in the private market, there is no formal public market for these major, exciting companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the ease of investing in memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The traditional stock market faces increasingly high hurdles and prohibitive costs for companies to go public, pushing opportunities from public to private markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

## [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | Tokenization]] as a Solution
[[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | Tokenization]] can provide liquidity to private companies and offer financial opportunities to end investors seeking access to private equity working on the technological frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
Examples of existing [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | tokenization]] include:
*   Stablecoins as tokenized treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Paxos's tokenized gold product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

The next step is the [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | tokenization]] of securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, which can be thought of as an evolution of existing TradFi mechanisms like ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Benefits of [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | Tokenizing]] Private Securities
1.  **Global Investor Access**: It increases the pool of shareholders for US companies by making it easier for overseas investors to access them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Just as stablecoins promote US dollar dominance, tokenized securities can push forward US company dominance in the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
2.  **Wealth Building**: It provides effective wealth-building tools for people outside the US, offering diversification against local currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
3.  **Capital Formation**: By making it easier to raise capital in the US through a global crypto market, [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | tokenization]] can foster more interesting companies and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

## Use Cases for [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | Tokenized]] Securities

### Early-Stage Private Companies
For companies at the absolute early stages of formation, [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | tokenization]] serves as primary capital, akin to a traditional IPO where capital is raised from shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This allows founders to tap into a global pool for fundraising, completing capital raises quickly and freeing up valuable mindshare and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This could lead to more companies, projects, and exposure at the earliest stages, where risk is highest but upside opportunity is greatest for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

### Late-Stage Private Companies
For large, late-stage private companies like OpenAI or SpaceX, the value proposition shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. Founders may have already raised significant capital, but employees, numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands, often seek liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. They lack visibility into IPOs or other liquidity events and are interested in diversifying their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

While secondary platforms like Equity Zen or Forge exist, they face fragmented liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | Crypto]] benefits from interoperability; once an asset is on the blockchain, it is freely tradable and immediately accesses global liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

## Addressing IPO Hurdles
The trend of declining public market IPOs due to high costs and prohibitive barriers makes [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | tokenization]] a compelling alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Even if the US is slow to adopt, other countries are setting up frameworks for issuing crypto asset securities, leveraging crypto's global nature to tap into an increasingly liquid market with hundreds of millions of participants worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Robinhood's Role
Robinhood aims to be at the intersection of traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. With existing crypto technology and traditional financial infrastructure, including multiple broker-dealers, Robinhood sees itself as a potential marketplace for tokenized equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

## Regulatory Landscape
The true power of crypto technology will be unlocked when market structure legislation provides clarity on:
*   What qualifies as a crypto asset security versus a crypto asset commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   The steps platforms need to take to list crypto asset securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   The requirements for companies or issuers to issue crypto asset securities to the American public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

This clarity would allow for products like yield-bearing stablecoins and more competition in the banking sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Robinhood is actively engaged in Washington to help shape this legislation, which is seen as moving in a positive direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## The Inevitable Future
Multiple trends, including the increasing cost of IPOs and the growth of exciting private companies like SpaceX, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, point towards the inevitable conclusion of [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | tokenizing]] private market equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This could effectively become the pseudo-public markets of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

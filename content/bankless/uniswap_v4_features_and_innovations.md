Uniswap V4 has officially launched on 12 chains, representing a highly anticipated update from Uniswap V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. The Uniswap protocol has processed over $2.5 trillion in all-time swap volume, establishing itself as a premier liquidity hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The latest iteration, V4, continues to build on this foundation by introducing significant innovations and improvements.

## Core Features and Benefits

Uniswap V4 brings several enhancements to the decentralized exchange (DEX) landscape:
*   **Cheaper Pool Creation** Pools are now 99.99% cheaper to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.
*   **Native ETH Support** V4 includes native Ethereum (ETH) support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.
*   **Significant Savings on Swaps** Swappers can expect substantial savings on multi-hop swaps due to the absence of additional gas costs for adding new sources of liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.
*   **Multi-Chain World Design** Uniswap apps are designed for a multi-chain environment, supporting [[ethereums_scalability_and_innovation | Ethereum]] mainnet, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, and ZK Sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   **Seamless User Experience** Transactions sync across web interface, mobile apps, and Chrome browser extensions, providing device flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Security** The platform maintains self-custody for funds and offers MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) protection, ensuring secure swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

## Introducing V4 Hooks

The most significant innovation in Uniswap V4 is the introduction of **hooks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. Hooks are smart contract plugins that enable customization of various parameters around Uniswap pools, swaps, fees, and LP (Liquidity Provider) positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>. This feature opens up a vast "white space" for new developments and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.

Examples of hook functionalities include:
*   Dynamically adjusting swap fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.
*   Lending unused liquidity for additional yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   Implementing MEV protection strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>.

### Noteworthy Hook Projects

Several projects are already leveraging V4 hooks to create diverse applications:

*   **Flunch** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>
    *   A meme coin token launchpad with additional features beyond inert meme coins, aiming to create more active projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

*   **Cella** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>
    *   Focuses on MEV protection for Uniswap LPs, helping them to avoid losses from MEV and even capture MEV to increase liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
    *   Utilizes a cool auction mechanism to return value to LPs, preventing losses from CEX-to-DEX arbitrage that often occurs due to [[ethereums_scalability_and_innovation | Ethereum]]'s 12-second block time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.

*   **Doppler** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>
    *   Offers a more sophisticated strategy for liquidity provision compared to platforms like [[the_launch_of_pump_swap_and_its_impact_on_Radium_and_Solana | Pump Fun]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.
    *   Unlike [[the_launch_of_pump_swap_and_its_impact_on_Radium_and_Solana | Pump Fun]], which is designed for low-friction meme coin creation with immediate sniper bot filling and transfer to [[the_launch_of_pump_swap_and_its_impact_on_Radium_and_Solana | Radium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>, Doppler caters to teams with a long-term value creation plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
    *   It manages initial price appreciation by releasing tranches of supply onto the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>, providing a better market structure for sustainable projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

## Strategic Shift Towards a Platform

The evolution of Uniswap from V1 to V4 illustrates a shift from a simple application serving a specific customer type to a more complex platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. This platform approach allows for any new AMM (Automated Market Maker) designers to build their desired AMMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

This modular design minimizes concerns like security audits, as developers can build on Uniswap's audited infrastructure, saving significant time and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>. By opening up as a developer platform, Uniswap enables competition and inspires a new generation of AMM designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

This trend of becoming more modular to accommodate diverse customer types and evolve into a platform is expected to be a massive trend within decentralized finance (DeFi) in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. It pushes complexity to the edges, providing more surface area for innovation, startups, and new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.

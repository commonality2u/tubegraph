## Misconceptions about Crypto ETFs

There is a common misperception that [[Impact of Market Valuations and Crypto Assets | Ether (ETH) ETFs]] were not as successful as [[Impact of Market Valuations and Crypto Assets | Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, within the ETF industry, Ether ETFs had genuinely successful launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of ETFs and Index Investments at [[BlackRocks crypto investment strategy | BlackRock]], clarifies that for the industry, a successful ETF delivers what it is supposed to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This means tracking the underlying index with precision and demonstrating high market quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Both Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have met these criteria, showing high market quality and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

Another misperception is that creating an ETF drives flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. Instead, [[Crypto market and investment strategies | investor sentiment]] drives flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. For investors in 2024, the thesis around Bitcoin was more tangible than that of Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>, explaining the disparity in flows between the two assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. While the Bitcoin ETF broke all historical records, the Ether ETF still ranked in the top 20% of ETF launches in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

## Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance

The launch of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) in the US, defined as Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) by regulators, created a crucial bridge between the traditional finance (TradFi) world and the crypto world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This bridge proved useful to investors on both sides:
*   TradFi investors could allocate to Bitcoin through a familiar wrapper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   Digital-native investors found the ETP wrapper served their needs, with some even purchasing their first ETP through Bitcoin ETPs and subsequently other ETPs to build more diversified portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Bitcoin as a Portfolio Diversifier

[[BlackRocks crypto investment strategy | BlackRock's]] research focuses on how Bitcoin can manifest in a portfolio, considering its utility and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. The firm's research is rooted in understanding [[Investment strategies and risk | portfolio risk]] across various asset classes and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

### Investment Thesis and Market Relevance
The [[Fundamentals and Crypto Valuation Techniques | investment thesis]] for Bitcoin is simpler to explain compared to Ether's, often summarized as "digital gold" with a 21 million limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. This narrative has strong resonance in times of heightened geopolitical tension, concerns over broad-based disruptions, and the dollar deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Furthermore, 2022's challenging environment for TradFi investors, where both stocks and bonds declined, led to a greater need for diversification and alternative assets (alts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

### Allocation Recommendations
[[BlackRocks crypto investment strategy | BlackRock]] provides [[investor_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | investment research]] on Bitcoin's role in a portfolio, focusing on its potential diversification aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. In a piece analyzing portfolio interactions, BlackRock suggested that a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin could yield the same level of [[Investment strategies and risk | risk contribution]] as a "MAG 7" stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Allocations above 2% would signify a strong, specific view on Bitcoin, moving beyond the goal of portfolio diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. This research targets advisors, institutions, and individual investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

### Market Maturity and Options
For Bitcoin to be more broadly integrated into [[Analyzing Crypto Assets through Onchain Data and Indicators | risk]] and return conversations, more market cycles and data are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. The launch of options on Bitcoin ETPs in November was a significant development, as options ecosystems tend to create more balanced trading dynamics and enhance market quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Options provide new levels of transparency and access, enabling investors to tailor exposures, achieve income, and participate with limited downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. Historically, many institutional investors first engaged with Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) through options on these funds, seeking limited capital outlay and downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.

## Dispelling Misconceptions about ETF Impact

A common belief in the crypto community is that an ETF launch directly causes price appreciation for the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. However, launching an ETF does not "magically create price appreciation"; rather, it reflects existing market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. [[BlackRocks crypto investment strategy | BlackRock]] emphasizes that the success of an ETP is measured by its effective access, market quality, and its role in an investor's portfolio, not by the price action of the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. While inflows into Bitcoin ETFs may suggest net new buying, the significant volume of secondary trading (9 times more) between buyers and sellers of the ETP indicates that much activity occurs without new coin exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

Instead of price, [[BlackRocks crypto investment strategy | BlackRock]] advocates that "education is the best marketing for Bitcoin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. It's crucial for investors, particularly long-term ones, to understand that Bitcoin remains a risky and volatile asset despite recent price highs, as this volatility contributes to its investment thesis as a diversifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

## Future Outlook

[[BlackRocks crypto investment strategy | BlackRock's]] current focus for ETPs remains Bitcoin and Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. Beyond new coin ETPs, their broader digital assets strategy emphasizes:
*   Tokenization, particularly of Treasury funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.
*   The future path of stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.

The firm favors public over permissioned blockchains for tokenization, seeking open architecture and interoperability to operate at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Samara Cohen expresses optimism for 2025, hoping for a return to a more innovation-supportive regulatory environment that balances innovation with appropriate investor protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. Key regulatory priorities include establishing basic definitions (e.g., what constitutes a security), clear jurisdictions, and fostering collaboration between the public and private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>.

The [[Ethereum Foundation Leadership Changes | Ethereum Foundation (EF)]] has recently undergone a significant [[Ethereum Foundation Leadership Changes | leadership transition]], welcoming Tamas Stanczak and Shiae Wang as its new co-executive directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This shift is seen as a necessary move for the direction of Ethereum, with hopes for accelerated upgrade cadences and prioritized product mindfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## New Co-Executive Directors

### Shiae Wang
Shiae Wang, with a background in computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, joined the [[role_and_responsibilities_of_the_Ethereum_Foundation | Foundation]] in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. She began as a core protocol researcher, working on early sharding concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> and later contributing to the transition to Proof of Stake (the Merge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. As a co-lead of the [[role_and_responsibilities_of_the_Ethereum_Foundation | Foundation's]] consensus R&D team, she focused on consensus layer specifications and coordinated between research and client implementers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Shiae joined the [[role_and_responsibilities_of_the_Ethereum_Foundation | Foundation's]] leadership team in December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, bringing a focus on how features impact users and bring value to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. She aims to lead with clarity, move with purpose, and build without personal attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>, emphasizing the goal of making Ethereum the most decentralized, permissionless, and open blockchain globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

### Tamas Stanczak
Tamas Stanczak's journey with Ethereum began in late 2015/early 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. He founded Nethermind in August 2017, which is now recognized as a core development infrastructure company for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Nethermind has grown to about 300 people and runs a large internship program, bringing hundreds into the Ethereum ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Tamas's experience spans building applications, infrastructure, security, and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. He aims to bring operational energy and efficiency to the [[role_and_responsibilities_of_the_Ethereum_Foundation | Foundation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, focusing on internal structure, accelerating processes, and improving communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. He views his role as more executive than vision-setter, aiming to be dynamic and adjust to expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. His vision is for Ethereum to be seen as a global neutral layer for all economic and governance transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

## [[Role and responsibilities of the Ethereum Foundation]] and Leadership Vision

The [[role_and_responsibilities_of_the_Ethereum_Foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] is a non-profit organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a> that serves as a central coordinator and compass for the entire Ethereum operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Its mission is to be a steward of the ecosystem, stepping up when needed and empowering other players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The new co-directors emphasize principles that are stable and resilient, allowing for flexible focus on dynamic topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

### Addressing Past Criticisms
The community has generally given the [[role_and_responsibilities_of_the_Ethereum_Foundation | EF]] high marks for its research, enshrined values, and diverse set of stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>. However, criticisms have included:
*   **Slowness** The inability to accelerate timelines or commit to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. Tamas believes these issues are "very much" fixable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.
*   **Communication** Lack of clear roadmap communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>, with the Ethereum Twitter account only recently becoming active again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.
*   **"Ivory Tower" Perception** A feeling that the [[role_and_responsibilities_of_the_Ethereum_Foundation | EF]] is disconnected from true user cases and DeFi builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

The new [[Ethereum Foundation leadership and community dynamics | leadership]] aims to address these by increasing communication, making the EF a "helper" and "business developer" connecting organizations and talent, rather than solely a grant provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>. They also aim to empower internal team leads to drive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

### [[Ethereums strategic pivot and its implications]]
The new [[Ethereum Foundation leadership and community dynamics | leadership]] defines [[Ethereums strategic pivot and its implications | Ethereum's strategic roadmap]] with three core objectives for the next 12 months:
1.  **[[Shift in focus of the Ethereum tech stack | Scaling the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1)]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>: This involves ensuring Ethereum L1 remains strong, outclassing competitors in quality of research, protocol strength, decentralization, security, and throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.
2.  **[[Shift in focus of the Ethereum tech stack | Scaling Blobs for Layer 2s]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>: This signifies general support for the L2 ecosystem, binding it to L1 by delivering the anchoring layer from which L2s can borrow security and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
3.  **Improving User Experience (UX)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>: This includes addressing interoperability problems across L2 chains, concerns about L2-L1 relationships, ease of use, security, and asset management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. It also extends to Developer Experience (DevX), ensuring builders have a great experience on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.

This [[Ethereums strategic pivot and its implications | strategic pivot]] reflects a move towards a "product-centric Ethereum," where changes and features are driven by user needs and impact, involving the community in the co-design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

## Operational Goals and Metrics
The new [[Ethereum Foundation leadership and community dynamics | leadership]] is committed to speed of execution, accountability, clear goals, objectives, and trackable metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. A significant target is a 100x scaling increase over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>, starting with a 3x increase this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.

Hard forks are planned for every six months, a significant acceleration from the historical 12-18 month cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>.
*   **Pectra** is planned for May 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>, focusing on UX improvements via EIPs like EIP-7549 and account abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.
*   **Fusaka** is targeted for September/October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>.
*   **Glamsterdam** is planned for March-June next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.

The [[Ethereum Foundation leadership and community dynamics | leadership]] aims to prevent delays by focusing teams and immediately addressing anything that might hinder a fork's delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.

## What the EF Does Not Do (And Community Expectations)
While the community has high expectations, the [[Ethereum Foundation leadership and community dynamics | Ethereum Foundation leadership and community dynamics]] clarifies that the EF is not set up to do everything.
*   **Selling ETH**: The community expects the EF to hold ETH, but it must sell some to fund operations and grants for over 200 internal efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   **Direct Engineering Work**: The EF does not build consensus or execution layer clients; these are built by separate teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>.
*   **Market Manipulation/Business Development**: The EF is not responsible for influencing ETH price (like Michael Saylor with Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>, nor does it extensively engage in traditional Wall Street-style business development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. However, it is available to answer questions and act as a knowledgeable resource for institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.
*   **Owners of Ethereum**: The [[role_and_responsibilities_of_the_Ethereum_Foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] is not and does not act as the owner of the Ethereum protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>. Their role is to help others make decisions and empower high-agency individuals in the protocol space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:53">[01:21:53]</a>.

Instead of directly performing all these functions, the [[Ethereum Foundation leadership and community dynamics | EF]] aims to fill gaps in the ecosystem by highlighting problems and helping other organizations appear and grow to deal with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>. The [[Ethereum Foundation leadership and community dynamics | EF]] can also generate value by involving and connecting other ecosystem participants like accelerators, incubators, VCs, and L2s to multiply their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:35">[01:24:35]</a>. They believe creating a strong social network is a key role for the [[role_and_responsibilities_of_the_Ethereum_Foundation | Foundation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams has emerged as a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, consistently advocating for its adoption and demonstrating his personal alignment by converting his paychecks into digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Personal Crypto Adoption and Advocacy
In 2022, Eric Adams became the first American mayor to convert his initial three paychecks into cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Despite initial skepticism and laughter from many, Adams has repeatedly highlighted this decision, asking "who's laughing now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He is described as "such a crypto person now," often reminding people that he "got in early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. His continued public support and personal investment underscore his conviction in the digital asset market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## New York City Crypto Summit
Adams is actively involved in promoting crypto in New York City, serving as a host for a "New York City crypto conference," also known as the New York City Crypto Summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This initiative signals a move towards making New York more crypto-aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. While the mayor's role is limited to municipal influence and he cannot unilaterally remove state-level regulations like the BitLicense, his personal actions, such as buying Bitcoin and receiving paychecks in it, reinforce his pro-crypto stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Some commentators suggest his actions might also be a "[[trumps_procrypto_presidency_impacts | Trump alignment thing]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

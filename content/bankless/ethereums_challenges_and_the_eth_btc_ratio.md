## The Declining ETH/BTC Ratio
The ETH/BTC chart currently appears to be in a difficult state, with the ratio dropping below 0.02. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a> The ETH/BTC ratio has been on a significant downward trend, even accelerating, for nearly a thousand days. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a> This decline is seen as representing a "thinning out" of the "blockchain maximalist" thesis, which envisions extensive on-chain applications and digital identities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>

This decreasing ETH/BTC ratio is connected to lowered VC funding and a general negative sentiment on crypto Twitter. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>

### Normalizing for Bitcoin Dominance
When analyzing the ETH/BTC ratio, it is crucial to normalize for [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] dominance, as [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]]'s dominance has increased relative to *all* other assets, not just [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Ethereum]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a> This trend is largely attributed to a "risk-off" sentiment in the broader macro environment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>

Despite this broader market trend, the ETH/BTC ratio's poor performance for [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Ethereum]] specifically suggests there are "idiosyncratically weak" factors at play unique to [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Ethereum]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>

### Relationship to Monetary Policy
The ETH/BTC ratio is also seen as an indicator of "hard money" and quantitative tightening (QT) from the Federal Reserve. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a> For the ETH/BTC ratio to reverse and signal an "altcoin season," the Federal Reserve would need to cease QT and initiate quantitative easing (QE), or at least adopt a significantly looser monetary policy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a> A reversal of liquidity, potentially from such monetary policy shifts, would be reflected in the ETH/BTC ratio. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>

## Ethereum's Idiosyncratic Weakness and Necessary Changes
There is an "idiosyncratically weak" aspect to the ETH/BTC ratio's performance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>

> "What do people want to hear from [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Ethereum]]? They want to hear from [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Ethereum]] that we're not on autopilot. We are actually going to change our strategy. We're going to be more muscular in storytelling, in DC, in supporting entrepreneurs, in supporting DeFi, and we're going to scale the L1. Right? That's what people want to hear very clearly. Everyone's telling you it's not even a secret." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>

The longer [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Ethereum]] takes to explicitly state, signal, and credibly demonstrate these changes, the more the asset will continue to be penalized. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a> This indicates that beyond general market trends, [[challenges_ethereum_faces_in_the_crowded_layer_1_space | Ethereum]] faces specific internal challenges that need addressing to improve its competitive standing.

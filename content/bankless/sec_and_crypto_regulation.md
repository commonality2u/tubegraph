The [[role_of_the_sec_and_future_of_crypto_regulations | Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]], specifically its [[secs_crypto_task_force_with_mark_uesda | Crypto Task Force]], is actively engaging with the crypto industry to establish a clearer [[role_of_regulation_in_the_crypto_industry | regulatory framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>. This represents a significant shift towards a more collaborative approach compared to past periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.

## Hester Peirce and the Crypto Task Force
SEC Commissioner [[role_of_hester_peirce_and_the_sec_crypto_task_force | Hester Peirce]], often nicknamed "Crypto Mom" since 2018 for her dissent on the rejection of a Bitcoin ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:49">[04:17:49]</a>, has been appointed to lead the [[secs_crypto_task_force_with_mark_uesda | SEC's Crypto Task Force]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. This appointment by acting chair Mark Uyeda occurred shortly after the change in the SEC Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

The **[[secs_crypto_task_force_with_mark_uesda | Crypto Task Force]]** was created on January 21st, coinciding with a new administration, and aims to address crypto-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:44">[06:08:44]</a>. It is primarily composed of long-time SEC staff with diverse expertise from across the commission, with some outside experts also being brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. The task force welcomes input from the public to help shape its approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

## Key Regulatory Developments
### Repeal of SAB 121
One of the immediate actions taken by the task force was the repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:45">[06:14:45]</a>.
*   **Impact**: SAB 121 had limited the number of entities willing to undertake crypto custody due to severe consequences, hindering participation from traditional custodians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Significance**: Its repeal is expected to open the door for more participants in the crypto custody space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. Commissioner Peirce emphasized the importance of transparency in [[regulation_changes_in_the_crypto_industry | regulation changes]], which the repeal helps achieve by returning to a more transparent baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

### Retroactive Relief and Safe Harbors
The task force is considering recommending commission action to provide temporary prospective and retroactive relief for coin or token offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: This initiative aims to encourage disclosure from issuing entities by making it a "plus" rather than a "negative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. The goal is to address information asymmetries and provide a runway for projects to achieve more dispersed control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:20]</a>.
*   **Context**: This approach is designed to bridge the gap until Congress can pass comprehensive [[regulation_changes_in_the_crypto_industry | legislation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. Commissioner Peirce has previously proposed a draft Safe Harbor for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

### No-Action Letters
The task force welcomes requests for no-action letters for areas that may fall outside the SEC's jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.
*   **Definition**: A no-action letter indicates that SEC staff will not recommend an enforcement action if specific circumstances are followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: They offer projects some comfort and insight into staff thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. An example cited was the Flyfish Club NFT case, which might have benefited from such relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>.
*   **Distinction**: The SEC is balancing no-action relief with more formal rulemaking processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>.

## Industry Engagement and Concerns
Commissioner Peirce acknowledges the crypto industry's nervousness about engaging with the SEC due to past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>. She emphasizes the need to change the agency's culture and build trust through positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. The task force aims to find practical, workable solutions that do not undermine securities laws but allow for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>.

### Enforcement Actions
The current "hairball" of ongoing enforcement actions is a complex issue, with each case requiring assessment based on its specific facts and circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>. Policy made through enforcement actions can hinder new regulatory goals, and the task force is sensitive to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>.

### Collaboration with CFTC
There is optimism for improved collaboration between the SEC and the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>. Commissioner Peirce has a history of working with CFTC commissioners to align regulatory regimes, and she hopes to apply similar lessons to crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>. The goal is to determine where jurisdiction makes the most sense across the SEC, CFTC, FTC, and state regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.

## Specific Crypto Asset Considerations
### Crypto Tokens as Securities
While some crypto tokens will undoubtedly be securities, particularly traditional equity or debt finding their way onto blockchains, Peirce questions whether most decentralized projects will fit neatly into traditional securities laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>. The concern is that applying a securities law framework, with intermediaries, might contradict the goal of wide participation and peer-to-peer networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>.

### Raising Capital and Investor Accreditation Laws
The SEC is likely to focus on [[regulatory_developments_in_the_united_states_impacting_the_crypto_industry | Capital Formation]] and providing broader access to private markets for unaccredited investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>.
*   **Current Exemptions**: Existing mechanisms like Reg A and Reg CF, which democratize investing, could be useful for crypto projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:00">[38:28:00]</a>.
*   **Accreditation**: The idea of requiring wealth or income to access investments is seen as "un-American" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:45:00">[39:45:00]</a>. Alternatives like educational qualifications or tests for accreditation are being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:47:00">[40:47:00]</a>.
*   **"Buyer Beware"**: Peirce supports a system with two options: public markets with full disclosures and protections, or segments of the economy with more access but requiring investors to be more "buyer beware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:40:00">[42:42:40]</a>. Diversified access to private markets is also a focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:05:00">[44:05:00]</a>.

### Meme Coins and Airdrops
*   **Meme Coins**: The SEC's jurisdiction over meme coins depends on facts and circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:00">[44:40:00]</a>. Commissioner Peirce cautions against assuming an SEC regulatory "backstop" or government bailout for meme coins, emphasizing individual responsibility for choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:00">[45:01:00]</a>.
*   **Airdrops**: Guidance on airdrops, especially for US citizens, is being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:04:00]</a>. Whether an airdrop is a security depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.
*   **Anti-Fraud Laws**: Regardless of SEC jurisdiction, anti-fraud laws in the United States still apply, and the SEC will refer potential fraud to the appropriate entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:06:00">[48:06:00]</a>.

## Future Priorities
The [[secs_crypto_task_force_with_mark_uesda | Crypto Task Force]] has many areas of focus, including:
*   Broker-dealer and investment advisor custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">[49:15:00]</a>.
*   DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:29:00">[49:29:00]</a>.
*   Applications for [[regulatory_developments_affecting_crypto_etfs | Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:57:00">[49:57:00]</a>.

A core priority is to clarify whether specific activities are covered by the SEC's jurisdiction early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:21:00">[51:21:00]</a>.

Commissioner Peirce's term at the SEC concludes in June 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>. She expresses excitement about the current opportunity to make positive, productive changes and foster an environment where builders can innovate without excessive legal concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:00:00">[53:00:00]</a>. The goal is to create a functional system that allows building and differentiates between good and bad actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>.

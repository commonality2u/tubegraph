BlackRock, overseeing a colossal $6.6 trillion in ETFs and index investments, plays a significant role in the evolving landscape of traditional finance (TradFi) and the emerging crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of ETFs and Index Investments at BlackRock, emphasizes the company's commitment to modernizing markets through technology and strategic product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Samara Cohen: A Career Markets Modernizer

Samara Cohen identifies herself as a "career markets modernizer," driven by a passion for making markets more resilient, transparent, and useful for more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. She highlights that technological innovation has been foundational to market modernization for millennia, citing examples from ancient Mesopotamian clay tokens to the development of index strategies enabled by the first commercial microchip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This historical perspective frames BlackRock's approach to integrating blockchain technology into traditional financial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Evaluating the Success of Crypto ETPs

Cohen clarifies a common misconception: while [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Ether ETFs]] may not have seen the same inflow volumes as [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Bitcoin ETFs]], they were still considered "really successful launches" within the ETF world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. BlackRock measures an ETF's success primarily by:
*   **Precision Tracking**: How accurately it tracks the underlying index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **Market Quality**: The existence of an ecosystem of players that create trading volumes, liquidity, and on-exchange access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

Both the [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Bitcoin ETFs]] (which BlackRock refers to as Exchange Traded Products or ETPs, due to regulatory definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>) and [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Ether ETFs]] have demonstrated high market quality and tracking precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

### Flows and Investor Sentiment
The disparity in flows between [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Bitcoin]] and [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Ether]] ETPs is attributed to investor sentiment, not the ETP structure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin's Narrative**: The investment thesis for Bitcoin is seen as more tangible due to heightened geopolitical tension, concerns over broad-based disruptions, and the dollar's deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Investors also considered Bitcoin as a potential diversifier after a challenging 2022 where both stocks and bonds declined together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
*   **Ether's Narrative**: The [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Ether]] story is perceived as less of a diversifier and more of an amplifier to existing mega-cap tech exposures investors already hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

Despite the flow differences, the [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Ether ETF]] was still among the top 20% of ETF launches in the United States in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

## [[asset_allocation_strategies_for_crypto_investors | Asset Allocation Strategies]]

BlackRock provides investment research rooted in portfolio risk, rather than direct investment advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. They have published research on Bitcoin's role as a diversifier in portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.
Their analysis suggests that a **1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin** could result in a similar level of risk contribution as a MAG 7 stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. Allocations above 2% would indicate a strong, specific view on Bitcoin rather than diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. This research is primarily targeted at financial advisors and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

## Future of Crypto ETPs and Market Development

BlackRock hopes to see more conversation in 2025 about how Bitcoin manifests in portfolios, moving beyond a simple "Bitcoin or not Bitcoin" debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. The limited historical data for Bitcoin still poses a challenge for traditional back-testing and analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

### Options and Transparency
The launch of options on [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Bitcoin ETPs]] in November was a significant moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Options ecosystems generally create more balanced trading dynamics, with buyers and sellers active at different price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. While innovation and complexity go hand-in-hand, BlackRock emphasizes the importance of clear education on options-based strategies for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
Options provide new levels of transparency and access to market sentiment, which is beneficial for healthy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Historically, institutional investors have often entered an asset class via the options market to limit initial capital outlay and downside risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

### Education vs. Price as Marketing
Cohen challenges the "price is marketing" adage common in crypto, asserting that **education is the best marketing for Bitcoin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. She stresses the importance of reminding investors that despite recent price rallies, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset, which is part of its investment thesis as a diversifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
BlackRock's measure of an ETP's success is not tied to the underlying asset's price appreciation, but rather its effectiveness in providing access, maintaining market quality, and serving a role in an investor's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.

### Broader Digital Asset Strategy
Beyond new coin ETPs, BlackRock's broader digital asset strategy focuses on:
*   **Tokenization**: Particularly of Treasury funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.
*   **Stablecoins**: Exploring their future path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.
Currently, BlackRock's near-term ETP strategy remains focused on Bitcoin and Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. Cohen indicates that the excitement for more coin ETFs in the crypto community is often driven by a misperception that an ETF launch magically creates price appreciation and liquidity for the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

> "Categorically launching an ETF does not magically create price appreciation, and by the way, this is a conversation I have had for the past 10 years wherever I go in the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>

She stresses that the investment thesis for each token must be well-defined, including how to measure it, describe cash flows, and assess risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

## Regulatory Landscape and Future Hopes

BlackRock closely engages with the SEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. Cohen expresses optimism for a return to a U.S. market environment that balances support for innovation with appropriate investor protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. Key regulatory hopes for 2025 include establishing:
*   **Definitions**: What constitutes a security in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
*   **Jurisdiction**: Clear identification of responsible regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
BlackRock favors open architecture and interoperability within financial ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. They believe a "separate crypto ecosystem" for regulation is not the best long-term outcome, preferring integration with existing TradFi frameworks to avoid duplicative regulations and allow existing players to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. This includes support for bills like FIT21 and the stablecoin bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

## Internal Collaboration at BlackRock

BlackRock's digital assets team, led by Robbie Mitnik, works horizontally across the firm, educating various business units—including ETFs, index trading, cash securities, lending, and derivatives—on potential use cases for digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. This approach encourages each business to integrate digital assets where they provide genuine solutions, rather than forcing blockchain technology onto problems it doesn't fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. The collaboration ensures that business results are prioritized, with teams committed to partnering with the digital assets group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>.

## Outlook for 2025

Samara Cohen expresses excitement and optimism for 2025, hoping for a renewed focus on the mission of creating a more transparent and accessible financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>. She believes that moving past the "anger at the system" and regulatory uncertainty of previous years will foster innovation and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>. The goal is to strike a balance between innovation and appropriate guardrails to maintain and grow investor confidence, which is crucial for the market to reach its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.

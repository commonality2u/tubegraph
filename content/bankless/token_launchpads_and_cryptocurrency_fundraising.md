The cryptocurrency industry is continuously exploring new avenues for capital formation, particularly through [[the_role_and_evolution_of_decentralized_finance_and_token_launchpads | token launchpads]] and innovative fundraising models. This evolution is giving rise to what some refer to as "[[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | Internet Capital Markets]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Rise of [[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | Internet Capital Markets]]

The concept of [[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | Internet Capital Markets]] is characterized by consumer applications launching tokens, effectively "slapping tokens onto them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> to enable new forms of fundraising.

### Early Iterations: Jelly Jelly
One of the first iterations of this trend was Jelly Jelly in January, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The idea was to create a memecoin for a startup without any promise of equity, which in Jelly Jelly's case, reached a $200 million market cap in a day before declining significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Believe App and [[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | Launchcoin]]
The Believe app and its associated token, [[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | Launchcoin]], represent a more recent development in this meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Previously known as Clout.me, a social token app, it pivoted to its current model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
Users can create coins by tweeting at a bot, and a key feature is a 1% trading fee, with half of the fees going to the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This mechanism aims to allow creators to fund their apps directly from memecoin trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Many of these projects are described as "vibe coded stuff" or launched by "young vibrant viral marketing style builders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Examples of Believe-launched projects:
> *   **Dupe:** An AI app that finds "dupes" (duplicates or alternatives) of items to save money, it is the largest market cap coin on Believe after [[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | Launchcoin]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
> *   **Gooncoin:** Despite Believe's focus on consumer apps, Gooncoin, a purely memecoin, quickly became the second-largest coin on the platform with a $50 million market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. It's reportedly associated with an Open AI employee whose last name is Goon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
> *   **Noodle.gg:** A game similar to the classic "worm game" where players pay to start with a worm and try to gobble up others for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

## Comparison of [[the_role_and_evolution_of_decentralized_finance_and_token_launchpads | Token Launchpads]]

### PumpFun vs. Believe
While both platforms facilitate token launches, a key difference is that Believe aims to attract "significantly more web 2" creators who wouldn't typically launch on [[boopf_fun_as_a_competitor_to_pumpfun_in_the_memecoin_launchpad_space | PumpFun]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. The promise of not having developers "dump" on investors and instead earning from trading fees is a narrative appealing to some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] "Meme coins slapped on a different wrapper"
> Critics argue that Believe and similar platforms are merely "memecoins slapped on a different rapper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, effectively rebranding memecoins as "idea coins" or "founder coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The core issue remains regulatory, as these tokens lack explicit utility or equity claims, making them highly speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### Radium Launch Lab vs. PumpFun
Radium Launch Lab, a "launchpad for launchpads," allows projects like Bonk to create their branded launchpads on top of its existing AMM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. This strategy appears to be gaining traction, with Radium Launch Lab's 24-hour fees (approximately $860,000) being comparable to [[boopf_fun_as_a_competitor_to_pumpfun_in_the_memecoin_launchpad_space | PumpFun]] ($1 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. Radium's AMM also doubles [[boopf_fun_as_a_competitor_to_pumpfun_in_the_memecoin_launchpad_space | PumpFun]] Swap in volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

Bonkf fun, built on Radium, commits a majority of its fees to buying back Bonkcoin, fostering ecosystem alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. This contrasts with [[boopf_fun_as_a_competitor_to_pumpfun_in_the_memecoin_launchpad_space | PumpFun]], which has reportedly made $700 million in fees that haven't necessarily gone back into the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

The current landscape of [[the_role_and_evolution_of_decentralized_finance_and_token_launchpads | token launchpads]] faces significant challenges in achieving sustainable [[tokenomics_and_investment | tokenomics]] and addressing regulatory concerns.

### Regulatory Hurdles and Pseudo-Equity
The ideal scenario is to enable the permissionless launch of [[tokenization_of_private_securities_and_its_opportunities | tokenized equity]] on-chain, but current regulations prevent this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Projects are forced to disclaim utility and promise no price appreciation, operating in a "handwavy" grey area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Meme Coin Pseudo-Equity Gap
> A major challenge is bridging the gap between memecoins and pseudo-equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. For a token to represent true pseudo-equity, proper capital structuring, organizational charts, and incentive alignment are needed, ensuring teams and investors hold sufficient tokens to be materially incentivized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This often means reverting to traditional corporate structures (like a C-Corp) for token allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Market Efficiency and Fee Compression
The market for [[the_role_and_evolution_of_decentralized_finance_and_token_launchpads | token launchpads]] is becoming more competitive, leading to fee compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. While some platforms like [[boopf_fun_as_a_competitor_to_pumpfun_in_the_memecoin_launchpad_space | PumpFun]] may maintain a "moat" around their brand and volume, forcing fees to near zero is unlikely in this chaotic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

## Impact on Ecosystems

### Solana and Memecoins
The rise of memecoins on Solana, particularly with the professionalization brought by [[boopf_fun_as_a_competitor_to_pumpfun_in_the_memecoin_launchpad_space | PumpFun]], has led to capital dispersion rather than direct accrual into Solana's native token (SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. This has created an argument that memecoins are "actively bad to soul" due to selling pressure from fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

### Ethereum and Layer 2s
Similarly, the Bitcoin-Ether ratio stopped going up around the emergence of Ethereum Layer 2s, as capital became dispersed into these Layer 2s rather than concentrated in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. Despite a recent 48% 7-day candle for ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>, ETF inflows have been flat or even outflows, suggesting the buying is largely "cryptonative" rather than institutional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

> [!INFO] Ethereum's Strengths
> Ethereum's strength lies in its potential to attract institutional capital through the [[tokenization_of_private_securities_and_its_opportunities | tokenization of private securities]] and its large stablecoin presence ($150 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. However, whether this translates into significant ETH price appreciation remains a question, as institutions acquiring tokenized assets on Ethereum don't necessarily need to acquire ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

## Corporate Acquisitions and Market Liquidity

Recent merger and acquisition (M&A) activity indicates a broader liquidity injection into the crypto industry.

### Coinbase and Deribit
Coinbase, having recently joined the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>, acquired Deribit for approximately $2.3 billion, with $700 million in cash and the rest in Coinbase stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. Coinbase's balance sheet also shows increased Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

### Robinhood and WonderFi
Robinhood recently acquired WonderFi, a Canadian company with various financial services, including a testnet Layer 2 on the ZK Sync stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. The acquisition was for 250 million Canadian dollars ($178 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. Such acquisitions are often driven by the desire to quickly acquire existing infrastructure, teams, and, crucially, regulatory licenses in different jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.

### Stripe and Bridge
Stripe acquired Bridge for $1.1 billion a few months prior to launching stable financial accounts, demonstrating how traditional web2 companies are leveraging crypto acquisitions to expand their offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

These M&A activities inject outside capital into the ecosystem, potentially encouraging crypto-native founders to reinvest their gains, fostering a healthier funding market, and making it easier to underwrite equity investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

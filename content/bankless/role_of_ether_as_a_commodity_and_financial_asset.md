This article explores the evolving identity and strategic reorientation needed for [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] as a commodity and financial asset. It delves into the community's role in shaping [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | Ether's identity as a store of value]], distinguishing between Ether the asset and Ethereum the network, and the critical need for a renewed narrative to ensure its success in the global financial landscape.

## The "Blue Money Gospel" and Ether Maximalism

The discussion highlights a call for Ether maximalism, emphasizing that [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] is "good" and that an [[maximalist_approach_for_ether | Ether]] market capitalization reaching $10 trillion is beneficial for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. Without Ether the asset, there would be no DeFi and no cyberpunk values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:54">[01:30:54]</a>. A strong Ethereum network cannot exist without a strong Ether asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>.

It is argued that the Ethereum community has been "weak" in evangelizing the value of Ether, focusing instead on the network, bringing other assets on-chain, stablecoins, and Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>. This approach only addresses one half of making the economic system successful, neglecting the crucial role of [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. There is a perceived "wealth aversion" or hesitancy within Ethereum culture towards the monetary value of Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. It's argued that a rising Ether asset price benefits DeFi, and it's the only way to create a sovereign DeFi ecosystem not overrun by other tokenized assets or stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>.

### Learning from Bitcoin Maximalism

Bitcoin's success in becoming a $2 trillion decentralized store of value asset is attributed to its "gospel" or "religion" of "orange coin number go up 21 million" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:57">[01:54:57]</a>. Bitcoiners did the "hard thing" on the social layer through evangelism, focusing almost solely on the asset's value as money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:18">[02:02:18]</a>. Ethereum, despite building "the best settlement engine on earth," risks not achieving its goal of being a censorship-resistant monetary system without a strong Ether asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

The call is for the Ethereum community to "be like Bitcoiners" in their evangelism for [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. This includes:
*   Talking more about [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   Playing the "ground game" of memeing and belief propagation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   Convincing TradFi that "Bluecoin is good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>.
*   Encouraging holding [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] and celebrating those who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>.
*   Memeing [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>.
*   Proclaiming "one ETH equals one ETH" until it's "kindergarten math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>.

This maximalism for [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] the money is distinct from Ethereum the network, where pragmatism is still required for technological development, unlike Bitcoin's approach to its network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:49">[02:51:49]</a>.

## Ether as a Commodity Money Backed by an Economy

The prevailing valuation method for [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]], often based on discounted cash flow (DCF), is critiqued as "cash flow hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:22">[02:59:22]</a>. This method fails to grasp Ether's true nature as a "global censorship-resistant store of value like Bitcoin except it's programmable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:27">[03:00:27]</a>. The cash flow generated by Ethereum is denominated in Ether itself, making DCF analysis inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:04">[03:02:04]</a>.

Instead, Ether is presented as a [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | commodity money backed by an economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:56">[03:06:56]</a>. Investing in [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] is akin to buying an index of the internet economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:56">[03:06:56]</a>. Just as one might have bought a basket of US stocks, bonds, and property in 1947 to bet on "Pax Americana," buying [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] is buying the "indicy of the Ethereum property rights empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:56">[03:06:56]</a>.

Ethereum's "protocol rules are the constitution," the fee burn is like "taxes," rollup bridges are "trade routes," validators are a "defense system," and smart contract ownership represents "property rights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:56">[03:06:56]</a>. This contrasts with Bitcoin, which is digital gold but lacks a blowing-up on-chain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:56">[03:06:56]</a>. Ethereum is "miles ahead with respect to an on-chain economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:56">[03:06:56]</a>.

## Ether's Identity as a Store of Value

The goal for Ether is to sit "shoulder-to-shoulder with Bitcoin as the second money to emerge out of crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This does not necessarily mean "the flipping" (Ether surpassing Bitcoin in market cap) but rather the success of Ethereum's product stack leading to Ether becoming a "non-sovereign store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:40">[06:05:40]</a>. The vision is for two valued crypto monies: "digital gold" (Bitcoin) and "digital economy money" (Ether) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:48">[06:40:48]</a>.

Ether itself is considered the "number one use case" of Ethereum, acting as a censorship-resistant global store of value through its trading, borrowing, and lending activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:51">[02:19:51]</a>. Its financial properties imbue it with the same properties that are hard-won in the network, and the community should "lean into that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:51">[02:19:51]</a>.

## Community's Role in Shaping the Narrative

The Ethereum community itself is seen as an integral part of the "Ethereum product" being offered to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:17">[09:19:17]</a>. Just as Bitcoiners serve as marketers and salesforce for Bitcoin, the Ethereum community needs to market its product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:08">[09:29:08]</a>.

Key messaging shifts are needed:
*   **Promote the Layer 1**: Instead of "get off the layer 1" or "Ethereum is not for users," the message should be that Ethereum Layer 1 is the "economic hub of the internet" for everyoneâ€”builders, users, traders, speculators, and tokenized Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:04">[09:59:04]</a>.
*   **Embrace All Use Cases**: The community should stop "purity testing" and "gerrymandering support around products or apps or use cases which we find distasteful or immoral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:15">[10:54:15]</a>. This includes embracing memecoins, speculation, and trading, as traders and speculators are "the most important user group in crypto" and "bootloaders for an application layer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:58">[11:13:58]</a>. The permissionless nature of Ethereum's ecosystem means it shouldn't be policing use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:27">[11:25:27]</a>.
*   **Encourage ETH Holdings**: L2s, treasuries, whales, and DAOs should be encouraged, perhaps through "carrot tactics" (rather than shame), to hold a portion of their treasury in [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:53">[05:51:53]</a>. They should also accept transaction fees in Ether and center Ether in their wallets and dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:53">[05:51:53]</a>. Their success could be measured by how much [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] they import into their network and how they evangelize [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:53">[05:51:53]</a>.
*   **Focus on Bright Spots**: The evangelism should focus on what makes Ethereum "different and good and unique," exalting its valuable aspects without resorting to toxicity against other assets or chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:04">[11:33:04]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Ether

Currently, [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] is facing a "materially harder" environment compared to 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:15">[11:54:15]</a>. Bitcoin's continuous growth in branding as digital gold, and its recognition by governments like the United States, poses a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:15">[11:54:15]</a>. Meanwhile, [[ether_as_a_commodity_asset | Ether]] has "lost its moneyiness" and fallen into an "inferior valuation bucket" as a smart contract Layer 1 in a crowded marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:15">[11:54:15]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_ethereum_in_global_finance | challenges and opportunities for Ethereum in global finance]], Ether is believed to have the "highest upside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:15">[11:54:15]</a>. The "grand unified vision" of Ethereum, which includes not just being a store of value but an entire on-chain economy, represents the "largest Total Addressable Market (TAM) that exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:15">[11:54:15]</a>. This vision is seen as inaccessible to competitors like Solana or Bitcoin, making Ethereum uniquely positioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:15">[11:54:15]</a>.

The market currently prices Ethereum at a "tremendous discount," particularly when considering its potential to become a store of value asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:15">[11:54:15]</a>. If Ethereum can "pull off the reserve assets store of value and also the United Chains of Ethereum," it will be "unstoppable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:15">[11:54:15]</a>. The belief and conviction of the community are highlighted as crucial for realizing this potential, just as they were for Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:15">[11:54:15]</a>.

Defining what constitutes "enough" financial wealth is a concept the speaker had not previously explored in depth, despite discussions about crypto wealth over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This inquiry aims to identify a specific financial threshold that would allow the speaker and their family to achieve all their life goals, provide for loved ones, and eliminate the need to constantly monitor their financial "scoreboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Motivation Behind Defining "Enough"

The drive to define "enough" does not stem from greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, but rather from a genuine enjoyment of the "game" of growing a business and strategic investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It is viewed as a "fun" and "enjoyable game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The pursuit of "enough" is not about acquiring flashy status symbols, like a Lamborghini, but rather about achieving a "high score" in an arcade-game sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Previously, the speaker had failed to take the time to define "enough" with their spouse and others in their life, which was a significant missing piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This aligns with the broader topic of [[personal_perspectives_on_financial_goals]].

## Expanding the Definition of Wealth

The speaker realized their initial definition of wealth was excessively narrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Primarily, wealth was equated with net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, a metric often imposed by societal norms that define success as "number go up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This societal influence contributes to [[social_construction_and_consensus_on_asset_definitions]].

However, wealth encompasses more than just financial assets. A more [[comprehensive_definitions_of_wealth | comprehensive definition of wealth]] includes:
*   Financial wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Time wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Relationship/social wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Mental wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Physical wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

Upon considering these broader categories, the speaker realized they were "completely overallocated" in the financial aspect and were neglecting the other four types of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[balancing_different_types_of_wealth]].

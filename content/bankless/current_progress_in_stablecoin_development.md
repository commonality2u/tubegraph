The development of valuable [[stablecoin]]s is considered to be at an early stage, estimated at only 5% completion in terms of figuring out all potential construction methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Market Potential and Current Adoption

The global cross-border payments market is substantial, reaching $200 trillion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Currently, only about $50 billion of this cross-border volume is handled by [[stablecoin]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Despite the low current penetration, [[stablecoin]]s are deemed functionally and unequivocally superior for this use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Challenges and Infrastructure Needs

Significant [[challenges_and_infrastructure_needs_for_stablecoin_adoption | infrastructure problems]] need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of [[stablecoin]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These include:
*   **Compliance Concerns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   **Liquidity** Ensuring sufficient liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   **Cost Reduction** Bringing down transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   **Last-Mile Solutions** Addressing the final leg of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

Once these [[challenges_and_infrastructure_needs_for_stablecoin_adoption | infrastructure needs]] are met, a significant portion of the cross-border payments market, especially the Small and Medium Business (SMB) segment which accounts for about 40% of the total, is expected to be better served by [[stablecoin]]s and their underlying rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Comparison to Traditional Services

Traditional payment services like Wise target a significant market, estimated at $50 trillion in potential revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While Wise is a successful business, it is characterized as capital inefficient, requiring extensive interconnectivity and operational ties with the traditional banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This complexity would be significantly reduced or eliminated if transactions were conducted on [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | stablecoin rails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This suggests that existing players might either adapt to [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | stablecoin technology]] or face displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The conversation around [[ethereums_rollupcentric_roadmap_and_l2_differentiation | Ethereum's roadmap]] and its future has evolved, particularly with a renewed focus on a strong [[ethereum_roadmap_and_priorities | Ethereum Layer 1]] despite a continued [[ethereums_rollupcentric_roadmap_and_l2_differentiation | rollup-centric roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This shift in perspective for Ethereum prompts a broader discussion about Bitcoin's own rollup-centric roadmap and how its approach compares, particularly given the different goals each blockchain pursues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Rollup-Centric Approach

Bitcoin also has a rollup-centric roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>. The fundamental concern for Bitcoin is its security budget, as the block subsidy eventually goes to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. This necessitates usage of the chain to drive fees, which in turn secures the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>.

The Bitcoin community generally advocates against changes to the mainnet, with a strong preference for scaling solutions like the Lightning Network and emerging Bitcoin Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. This stance often translates to "don't ever do anything on mainnet ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

While there are long-term concerns about generating sufficient fees to maintain security against a 51% attack, many believe these issues will "work itself out" over time, either through increased fee generation or a collective trust in the mining cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. There's also a belief that Bitcoin may eventually increase its block size, as it has done previously, though this is seen as a distant possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

## Comparison with Ethereum's Roadmap

Historically, both [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | Ethereum and Bitcoin had largely similar roadmaps]], centered on not extensively scaling their respective Layer 1s and instead exporting activity to other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. However, key differences exist:

*   **Programmability**: [[ethereums_roadmap_and_priorities | Ethereum's Layer 1]] is programmable at its base layer, while Bitcoin is not, though it explores avenues like OP_CAT to introduce more functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.
*   **Problem Statement**:
    *   [[comparison_between_bitcoin_and_ethereums_value_narrative | Ethereum]] aims to significantly increase its valuation, potentially reaching "5 trillion dollars," by growing its Layer 1, users, applications, and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. This is about making the asset more valuable through utility and demand.
    *   Bitcoin's primary concern is generating sufficient fees to sustain a security budget in the millions to billions of dollars annually, preventing trivial 51% attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. Its valuation is seen as largely decoupled from its fee generation, as all fees go to miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.
*   **Value Accrual**: The [[economic_impact_of_native_rollups_on_ethereum | economic impact of native rollups on Ethereum]] is directly tied to the Layer 1's ability to accrue value. If L2s "extract all they want" without posting much back to the mainnet, the base layer's value accrual suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. Bitcoin's value proposition is less about fee accrual for the token itself and more about the fundamental desire to hold and use BTC as a non-sovereign monetary asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.
*   **User Demand**: Bitcoin benefits from an inherent user demand for BTC as an asset, which other tokens like ETH or SOL do not possess to the same magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. This makes Bitcoin's "ride" easier, as others must "ship the best technical product" to compete for user demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

## Implications and Outcomes

The "strategic pivot" in [[ethereum_roadmap_and_priorities | Ethereum's roadmap]] reflects a concern that its Layer 1 had become too weak, incentivizing core application developers to become chain developers rather than focusing on Layer 1 applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This weakness allowed Layer 2s to become somewhat "parasitic," capturing Layer 1 value due to an off-kilter equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. By increasing Layer 1 capacity, Ethereum aims to reset this equilibrium, ensuring that L2s must genuinely justify their existence through differentiation rather than simply being a cheaper, faster vanilla EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

For Bitcoin, the problem is different. Its "malaise" isn't tied to the price of its asset in relation to other cryptocurrencies, as its value narrative is fundamentally distinct from that of a smart contract platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. The primary concern is long-term security. Even if Bitcoin's L2s do not generate fees that justify a multi-trillion dollar valuation, they are expected to generate enough consistent fees to support miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>.

### Cultural Differences

The [[cultural_differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | cultural differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin communities]] significantly influence their respective approaches. Bitcoiners, focusing on the 21 million hard cap, prioritize the core value of BTC above all else, which means they are less concerned about Layer 2s' alignment as long as they contribute to the security budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Ethereum, conversely, has a broader "sphere of concern" that traditionally encompassed any Layer 2 settling to Ethereum, leading to a diffusion of focus from the Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The shift in Ethereum's focus to its Layer 1 means it is now actively trying to be competitive, even with its own Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.

The broader market perception also plays a role. Bitcoin is seen as the "special snowflake," the "digital gold," a narrative widely understood outside the crypto bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. Ethereum, as a "smart contract platform," competes within a different bucket, where its "odds of winning" have been perceived to decline due to growing competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. The "21 over infinity" argument highlights Bitcoin's finite supply as its ultimate moat against the commoditization seen in smart contract platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.

Ultimately, while both ecosystems utilize a rollup-centric approach, their underlying motivations, value propositions, and long-term challenges remain fundamentally distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.

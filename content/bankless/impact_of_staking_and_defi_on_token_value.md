Every Layer 1 (L1) blockchain features a native token, commonly referred to as an L1 token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Understanding how to value these tokens is crucial for investors to evaluate risks and anticipate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. L1 tokens constitute the vast majority of the total crypto market capitalization, often exceeding 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>. This includes prominent examples like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## L1 Tokens as Money, Not Company Shares

A core understanding is that L1 tokens function as money and accrue value like money, rather than as company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Money is defined as any asset primarily used for making payments and as a [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:52">[02:33:52]</a>. L1 tokens fit this definition because they are used for payments for on-chain services (e.g., gas fees for transactions) and as a [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | store of value]] through staking and deposits in decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

### Limitations of Traditional Valuation Methods

Historically, several models have been attempted to value L1 tokens:

*   **MV=PQ (Equation of Exchange):** This monetary theory links money supply (M) and velocity (V) to price (P) and quantity (Q) of goods/services (nominal GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. It was popular around 2016-2017 but has since fallen out of favor for valuing L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   **Stock-to-Flow:** Popularized by Bitcoin enthusiasts, this model assumes scarcity (ratio of existing supply to annual issuance) directly drives value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. However, it is primarily supply-side focused and assumes infinite persistent demand, which is a major limitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Relative Valuation (e.g., Bitcoin vs. Gold):** This approach compares Bitcoin's market capitalization to the [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | total addressable market]] (TAM) of gold, assuming Bitcoin can capture a percentage of gold's [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Proponents argue digital versions often surpass analog ones in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### Critique of Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and REV

A common contemporary approach, particularly for non-Bitcoin L1s, is to use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on a metric called "REV" (Revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

*   **REV Definition:** REV measures the total fees users pay to L1 validators, or the value validators capture from transaction activity on the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. It provides a snapshot of current demand to use a blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.
*   **Problem with DCF for L1 Tokens:**
    *   **Not Company Shares:** L1 tokens are not company shares; they do not accrue value like equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Native Currency Earnings:** Validators earn rewards in the native token (e.g., more ETH for staking ETH), not a non-native currency like USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. This creates a circular reference, making traditional DCF inappropriate for intrinsic valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
    *   **The "One Owner" Test:** If one person owned the entire supply of an L1 token (e.g., ETH), its value would be zero because there would be no network activity or fees being paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. This highlights that L1 tokens function as a network, unlike company shares whose value wouldn't change if centrally owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Fee Compression:** As blockchains scale, transaction costs (fees) generally tend to deflate or approach zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This means the revenue generated from payments will likely diminish over time, making it an unstable basis for long-term valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. While priority fees and transaction ordering might offer durable revenue streams due to fundamental supply constraints (time itself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, the overall trend of fees is downwards due to scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

DCF and REV are still useful for valuing non-L1 assets, such as DeFi protocols, whose tokens may accrue revenue in non-native currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Realized Store of Value (RSOV)

A more holistic framework, Realized Store of Value (RSOV), is proposed for valuing L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This metric tracks two primary drivers of [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | store of value]] (SOV) demand for L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>:

1.  **Realized Value of L1 Tokens Staked:** This measures the value of tokens committed to securing the network and earning staking yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
2.  **Realized Value of L1 Tokens in DeFi:** This measures the value of tokens deposited into DeFi protocols (e.g., for collateral, liquidity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

RSOV is inspired by Bitcoin's "realized cap," which represents the aggregate cost basis of the entire network, or the sum of all Bitcoin units valued at the price they were last moved on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Similarly, RSOV for smart contract platforms measures the aggregate cost basis of tokens specifically used for staking and DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

The key intuition behind RSOV is that these use cases represent instances where users are "buying and holding" the token, indicating a long-term reservation demand for the asset as a [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This contrasts with the payments use case, where fees tend to deflate as blockchains scale, making it less significant for long-term value accrual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### The Relationship Between REV and RSOV

While seemingly distinct, REV is elegantly incorporated into RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. When users pay high fees (high REV) for transactions, these fees are often distributed to stakers as native yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. If validators (stakers) hold or compound these rewards rather than immediately selling them, the realized value of staked tokens increases, thus boosting RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. In essence, high REV signifies a hastened transfer of the L1 asset from "spenders" to "savers" (stakers/DeFi users), who then buy and hold it, driving up RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

### Impact of Staking and DeFi on L1 Value

The value of an L1 token is fundamentally driven by sustained inflows of dollars into the network that *remain* within the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

*   **Staking:** Higher staking yields can attract more inflows, increasing the realized value of staked tokens and thus RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. A market's changing perception of an asset's risk (e.g., lower perceived risk leading to acceptance of lower yields) can also drive inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **DeFi:** Increased use of L1 tokens as deposit assets in DeFi (e.g., for collateral or liquidity) directly contributes to RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. The growth of the on-chain economy and the availability of more pairing assets (like stablecoins or tokenized BTC) further incentivize DeFi usage, driving RSOV growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Layer 2s:** The growth of [[market_movements_and_the_impact_of_stable_coins_on_ethereum | Layer 2]] (L2) solutions, while potentially displacing some Layer 1 sequencing revenue, can still positively impact RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. If L2s encourage more users to buy and use the underlying L1 token in DeFi or staking, it boosts the L1's realized value, even if the L1's direct transaction fees are affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Monetary Attributes:** Reliable issuance policies, hardened protocol rules, and easy-to-verify chains are crucial monetary attributes that enhance the appeal of digital crypto money relative to traditional fiat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

### Total Addressable Market (TAM) for Digital Non-Sovereign Money

Viewing L1 tokens through the RSOV lens opens up a much larger [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | Total Addressable Market]] (TAM) compared to traditional DCF analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This perspective compares the market cap of L1 tokens (e.g., Bitcoin, ETH, Solana) to the much larger markets of gold and traditional fiat base money (physically printed cash and bank reserves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

Current estimates suggest a TAM of $45 trillion for analog and government-backed base money, while digital crypto money currently stands at approximately $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. This indicates substantial upside potential (20x or more) for L1 tokens as they increasingly become credible non-sovereign [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | stores of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. The historical trend of digital disruptors eventually surpassing analog incumbents supports this long-term view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

### Price-to-RSOV Ratio

Comparing an L1 token's market capitalization to its RSOV provides insights into how much future growth is priced in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. A high price-to-RSOV ratio (e.g., Sui at 185x) suggests the market is making a very large bet on future growth of its [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | store of value]] usage in staking and DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. Conversely, if a token's market cap falls below its RSOV, it historically signals a strong buying opportunity, similar to Bitcoin's realized cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### Factors that Can Hurt RSOV

While RSOV measures inflows into the network, certain factors can hurt an L1's perceived [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | store of value]] properties and thus its RSOV growth:

*   **Centralization/Censorship:** If validators can censor transactions or freeze assets, it undermines the trust in the asset as an uncensorable, non-sovereign [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. This could lead to a decrease in RSOV as investors seek more reliable alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. Such incidents highlight that while an asset might still be a "currency," it may be "bad money" due to centralization risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.
*   **Market Perception of Risk:** A higher staking yield for an L1 token can paradoxically indicate that the market perceives higher risk, requiring greater compensation for holding the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.

Ultimately, L1 tokens are best viewed as commodities, not equities, and thus require valuation frameworks aligned with their monetary attributes and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. The RSOV framework aims to provide a data-driven, fundamental basis for understanding what truly drives the long-term value of these digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">[01:38:32]</a>.

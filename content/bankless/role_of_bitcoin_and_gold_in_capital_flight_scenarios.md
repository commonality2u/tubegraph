Concerns have been raised by non-American investors regarding the safety of keeping property domiciled in the United States, especially in the context of potential capital controls or taxes on foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Such policies are anticipated to lead to capital exiting US shores, causing a decline in the S&P and other negative economic effects, similar to those observed post-liberation day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Market Response to Capital Exit

The departure of foreign capital is mathematically expected to cause a decline in American property, stock, and bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This is because foreign entities have historically parked trillions of dollars of export earnings into American markets, which has served as a basis for the outperformance of US assets over the past 30 years compared to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. When capital markets decline, particularly the bond market, and volatility increases, the response typically involves printing more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Impact on Gold and Bitcoin

The imposition of capital controls necessitates that the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and politicians collaborate to create policies that provide dollars to replace the foreign capital that is leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This is primarily achieved by printing more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This action is projected to result in both [[impact_of_financial_policies_on_gold_and_bitcoin | gold]] and [[impact_of_financial_policies_on_gold_and_bitcoin | Bitcoin]] experiencing significant appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This scenario is considered a key trade opportunity within a rebalancing global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The anticipated capital exodus is viewed as highly beneficial for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

The traditional copyright system, designed during the era of the printing press, is increasingly [[current_limitations_of_the_copyright_system | outdated]] when confronted with the rapid pace of content generation on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Historical Context of Copyright Enforcement

Historically, the [[current_limitations_of_the_copyright_system | existing copyright system]] was well-suited for top-down distribution channels like books, radio, and television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Distribution was tightly controlled, allowing for effective [[challenges_of_enforcing_digital_ip_rights | enforcement]] of royalties. For example, radio producers and labels could easily work with local radio stations to enforce royalties for song usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The same applied to film transmission via TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Internet's Transformative Effect

The advent of the internet shifted content distribution from a top-down model to a peer-to-peer one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This change led to a proliferation of content creators and enabled content to be remixed and shared at an unprecedented speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Amplification by Artificial Intelligence

The challenge of managing copyright in the digital age has been exponentially compounded by the [[effects_of_ai_on_content_creation_and_copyright | rise of Artificial Intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. AI facilitates the generation of petabytes, or even "millions of petabytes," of content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This immense volume of new content further overwhelms the current system's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Need for an Updated IP System

The current copyright framework is unable to adequately support the contemporary reality of content creation and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. There is a critical [[need_for_an_updated_ip_system_compatible_with_internet_speed | need for an intellectual property (IP) system]] that is compatible with the speed of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Such a system should be programmable, allowing for instant registration of newly created IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Furthermore, it needs to address the [[challenges_in_registering_and_attributing_new_content | challenges of licensing and attribution]] for new content that is based on existing material, ensuring seamless and fair processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

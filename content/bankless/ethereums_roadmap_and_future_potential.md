It is considered "materially harder" for Ethereum to "win" in 2023 than it was in 2021 or 2022, indicating a significant challenge ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Current Challenges

Bitcoin's trajectory has seen continuous growth, solidifying its brand as "digital gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is now regarded as a "special snowflake" by the United States government, with the existence of a "strategic Bitcoin reserve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Ethereum "ought to aspire" towards such recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Conversely, Ether has "lost its moneyiness" and has consequently fallen into an "inferior valuation bucket" as a "smart contract layer 1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This market is described as "very crowded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. There is doubt about Ethereum's ability to compete effectively in this space against "much more centralized, faster moving competitors" who are "willing to cut corners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The current environment is "not suited to win in" for Ethereum, and it "needs to get out of that environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Future Potential

Despite current challenges, [[Ethereums roadmap and priorities | Ethereum's roadmap]] is seen as the "roadmap that all blockchains are on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This includes Bitcoin's desire for "layer 2" and Solana's "network extensions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. All these efforts are perceived as working towards a "grand unified vision for the blockchain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Ethereum possesses the "largest upside" if it can execute this vision "better than anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This unique execution would make it "inaccessible to Salana" and "inaccessible to Bitcoin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The "grand unified vision of Ethereum" represents the "largest TAM (Total Addressable Market) that exists," and the objective is to guide it to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

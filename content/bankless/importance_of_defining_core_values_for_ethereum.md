The Ethereum community has historically been characterized by its niceness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, this approach contrasts with other crypto communities, such as Bitcoin (BTC), which have effectively established "red lines" for their asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The BTC community, for instance, has been successful in socially defining Bitcoin as a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Their clear stance, like shaming those who confuse tokens with coins, serves as a coordination mechanism that benefits the BTC asset by maintaining its singular identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Necessity of Defining "Red Lines"

For Ethereum, it is crucial to clearly define specific areas or principles that will be non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This involves identifying "red lines" about which the community will take a firm stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Community Agreement on Values

Beyond defining these core principles, it is equally important for the Ethereum community to collectively agree upon what these "red lines" are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Without such agreement, a lack of cohesive direction can make the community appear disoriented and irrelevant to the broader world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Core Values for Ethereum

Two fundamental aspects highlighted as essential for Ethereum's core identity are:
*   **[[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | Store of Value]]**: Ensuring that Ethereum is widely recognized and utilized as a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Fundamental Ledger**: Maintaining Ethereum's role as the foundational ledger and settlement layer technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Failure to secure these definitions and widespread adoption of these core values would constitute a significant loss for the Ethereum project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

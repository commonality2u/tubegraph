[[US governments fiscal and monetary policy challenges | Fiscal dominance]] is a macroeconomic environment where government fiscal policy, including spending, borrowing, and deficits, takes precedence over central bank [[Impact of Federal Reserve policies on markets | monetary policy]] (such as interest rates and quantitative easing/tightening) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. In such a scenario, Congress is largely seen as being in control of the money supply, with the Federal Reserve (Fed) taking a backseat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Characteristics of Fiscal Dominance
Under [[Impact of fiscal dominance on monetary policy | fiscal dominance]], the actions of those running fiscal policy significantly impact the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This extends beyond just spending and borrowing to include other policies like tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Treasury Actions and Liquidity
The Treasury plays a crucial role in injecting liquidity into the market by running large deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. They can also influence liquidity by shortening the average duration of their debt, specifically by issuing extra T-bills, which are the most cash-like debt instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This strategy has been observed to offset the Fed's quantitative tightening efforts, effectively returning excess quantitative easing (QE) liquidity back into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This dynamic became particularly evident in early 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## How Fiscal Policy Impacts Monetary Policy
In a fiscally dominant environment, [[Impact of Federal Reserve policies on markets | monetary policy]] is largely influenced by, and often forced to accommodate, fiscal decisions.

### Central Bank Accommodation
When sovereign bond markets face issues, central banks typically "fold" and provide accommodation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. An example of this is the Bank of England's response to the guilt crisis in 2022, where they initiated emergency temporary QE to stabilize bond markets, despite the issue being primarily fiscal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. Similarly, the Fed provided pro-liquidity measures during the Regional Bank crisis, balancing inflation goals with the need to maintain financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.

### Presidential Influence on the Fed
A president can exert pressure on the Fed to implement more dovish policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. Additionally, the executive branch can appoint Fed chairs who are more aligned with their fiscal goals when a term ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.

### Treasury's Influence on Interest Rates
The Treasury can directly influence long-term interest rates by adjusting the duration of the debt they issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>. For example, issuing fewer long-duration bonds and more T-bills can lead to lower 10-year and 30-year yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. This approach is seen as a way to manage liquidity and can be considered a "slightly Emerging Market type of move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.

## Key Macroeconomic Factors and Outlook
The current macroeconomic climate is characterized by several interacting factors:
*   **Inflation:** Inflation has remained sticky, with consumer expectations showing an uptick, potentially due to tariff threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.
*   **Interest Rates:** The long end of the yield curve has remained hawkish despite some rate cuts, impacting mortgages and business loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
*   **Quantitative Tightening (QT):** The Fed continues to reduce its balance sheet, pulling liquidity out of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. This process is expected to face challenges, especially as the reverse repo facility, which provided a buffer of excess liquidity, winds down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. The Fed might need to stop balance sheet reduction or implement policies that enable banks to hold more treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.
*   **Debt Ceiling:** Debt ceiling negotiations can impact liquidity, as the Treasury might be forced to release cash into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.

### Outlook for Risk Assets
The next couple of years are expected to be "moderately good for liquidity but more bumps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>. An administration viewed as favorable towards [[Impact of monetary policy on cryptocurrencies | Bitcoin]] and crypto suggests potential upside surprises in regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. Assets like [[Crypto as a hedge against monetary policy shifts | gold]] or [[Crypto as a hedge against monetary policy shifts | Bitcoin]] may be perceived as protection against uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. However, policies like tariffs can impact profit margins of companies and add to market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>.

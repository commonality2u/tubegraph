From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Donald Trump announced a [[trumps_crypto_executive_order_and_national_crypto_stockpile | US crypto reserve]], which he stated would "Elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Initially, his announcement on Truth Social on March 2nd, 2024, mentioned XRP, Solana, and Cardano as part of this reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. He later revised his post to include Bitcoin and Ether, stating they would be "at the heart of the Reserve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The stated goal is to make the US the "crypto capital of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Initial Market Reaction and Reversal
Upon the announcement, crypto markets experienced a significant rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>:
*   Cardano (ADA) rose by about 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   Solana (SOL) went up 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   Ripple (XRP) increased by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   Ether (ETH) was up 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   Bitcoin (BTC) saw a 10% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
Approximately $300 billion was added to the total crypto market cap within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

However, this rally quickly reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. By Monday, markets had lost all gains and were even down, as questions arose about the feasibility of such a reserve and subsequent tariff announcements by Trump added to market uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Feasibility and Challenges
Experts questioned the unilateral nature of Trump's announcement, noting that a U.S. President cannot establish such a reserve without Congressional appropriation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   The U.S. government already holds Bitcoin due to criminal seizures, and could decide not to auction it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   However, for other cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Solana, or Ether, the government would need to purchase them, which requires Congressional approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   The likelihood of Congress allocating funds to buy cryptocurrencies like Cardano was seen as very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   Prediction markets like Poly Market reflected this skepticism, pricing the likelihood of a [[strategic_bitcoin_reserve_concept | Bitcoin reserve]] at 65% and a Solana reserve at only 31-32% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Criticisms and Motivations
Critics argue that the proposal is "obviously nonsensical" for non-Bitcoin assets, lacking any genuine strategic reason for the U.S. government to own them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   The move is widely perceived as an [[impact_of_a_pro_crypto_president_on_markets | opportunistic response to incentives]] from the crypto industry, particularly given its growing support for Trump's political campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   The inclusion of specific altcoins, reportedly pitched by entities like Ripple to make their own inclusion seem more legitimate, is seen as a "government bailout for your buddy who gets crypto news from TikTok" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   There are concerns about the politicization of the industry, as government ownership of significant crypto assets with on-chain governance (like Cardano) could imply implicit control or influence over the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   This approach is seen as a "short-sighted" and potentially "corrupting" influence on the crypto industry, fundamentally undermining its apolitical ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Nick Carter, a crypto commentator, rated the [[the_concept_and_implications_of_a_crypto_strategic_reserve | crypto reserve featuring Cardano and Ripple]] as "10 out of 10 crazy" in his chronological ranking of Trump's crypto schemes, which also included his NFT project, World Liberty Financial, [[trump_branded_cryptocurrency | Trump Coin]], and Melania's NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Despite the criticisms of Trump's personal crypto ventures, his administration's appointments to key regulatory bodies (like Hester Peirce and Brian Quintenz) are viewed positively by the crypto industry for their pro-crypto stances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. The general desire of the crypto industry is simply to be "left alone" by the government, rather than having active intervention in markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

The idea of the U.S. government holding a [[bitcoin_and_us_governments_strategic_reserve | Bitcoin reserve]] is considered more acceptable because Bitcoin is seen as beyond anyone's control, similar to how governments hold gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The argument is that while the government shouldn't speculate on new technologies, Bitcoin is no longer a speculative investment after 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

It is speculated that Trump, known for his adaptive and "fast and loose" approach to policy, might eventually walk back on the more economically destructive aspects of his proposals if they prove unpopular or ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. The crypto markets' response to these announcements reflects their uncertainty and concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

Non-Americans have questioned the safety of keeping property domiciled in the United States if policies like capital controls or taxes on foreigners are implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Such actions could lead to capital exiting US shores and a decline in the S&P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This scenario would reflect repercussions similar to those observed post-liberation day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Repercussions of Capital Exits

A reduction in the capital account surplus mathematically requires foreigners to sell their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The historical outperformance of American property, stock, and bond markets over the last 30 years compared to the rest of the world has been based on foreigners parking trillions of dollars of export earnings in these markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Consequently, if foreigners withdraw, these markets must decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Even a marginal departure of foreign capital can lead to market downturns, as exemplified by events between April 2nd and April 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Policy Response to Market Downturns

When markets decline, especially the bond market, and volatility increases, the response is typically to print money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The implementation of capital controls would necessitate the Treasury, [[impact_of_federal_reserve_policies_on_markets | Fed]], and politicians to create policies to supply dollars to replace the departing foreign capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This involves printing more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The expected consequence of this rebalancing of the global economy is a significant rise in the value of gold and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

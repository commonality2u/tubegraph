The concept and practical application of [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI agents]] are rapidly evolving, with significant developments in efficiency and integration, particularly within the [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI crypto]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These advancements are making [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI agents]] more accessible and powerful for a wide range of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Groundbreaking Developments: DeepSeek R1 Model

A significant breakthrough in the [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI crypto]] space is the emergence of DeepSeek R1, an open-source [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI model]] developed by a Chinese team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This model challenges established players like OpenAI due to its remarkable efficiency and low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Efficient Training Techniques
DeepSeek R1 showcases two groundbreaking research techniques:
1.  **Effective Data Utilization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>: Unlike traditional models that require immense compute power to train on vast datasets, DeepSeek refined the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It feeds a small amount of compute, allows the model to produce an output, and then self-reviews to refine its approach, requiring fewer steps and less compute overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This process of iterative self-correction addresses a common issue in early LLMs, which struggled with backtracking and correcting previous responses, often leading to "hallucinations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
2.  **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>: Instead of querying the entire model (or "brain") for every request, DeepSeek R1 selectively routes requests to only the necessary "expert" sections of the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This significantly reduces the energy and resources required to produce a strong output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Performance and Cost
> DeepSeek R1 passes benchmarks and performance tests comparably to OpenAI's top models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Despite some debate regarding its stated $6 million training cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, the model charges 95% less for API calls than OpenAI, demonstrating its real-world efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. DeepSeek R1 is measured to be 45 times more efficient than its US-based competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

### Impact on the Market: Jevon's Paradox
The increased efficiency of models like DeepSeek R1 has a paradoxical effect on the market, as described by Jevon's Paradox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This principle states that as technological advancements improve the efficiency of a resource, its overall consumption can increase rather than decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. For [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI agents]], cheaper compute means wider adoption and greater demand for GPUs, energy, and data infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This "induced demand" suggests that a surplus of compute due to efficiency gains will simply lead to more [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI models]] and applications being built, consuming the available resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## Mainstream Adoption & Open Source Movement
The emergence of highly efficient, open-source [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI models]] like DeepSeek R1 is accelerating the adoption of [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

### OpenAI and Perplexity's Agent Products
Major [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI setups]] like OpenAI and Perplexity have recently announced and teased their own agent products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. OpenAI's demo showcased an agent performing tasks like shopping and ordering pizza, and notably, their agents are using "computer use" functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. Perplexity also presented a similar "slick" demo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

### Open Source vs. Closed Source
While OpenAI's models remain closed source, the trends from DeepSeek and Meta's open-source initiatives suggest a push towards more accessible [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI agent]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. The fact that DeepSeek R1 is open-sourced means its engineering breakthroughs can be incorporated into other models, including those in the [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI crypto]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This implies that the value generated by cutting-edge [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI models]] will eventually flow into the open-source world, including open blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

The valuation of Layer 1 (L1) blockchain tokens is a crucial question in the cryptocurrency market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. With L1 tokens comprising the vast majority (around 95%) of the total crypto market capitalization, understanding their value drivers is essential for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## The Challenge of Valuation
Valuing L1 tokens is often described as a "trillion-dollar question" because traditional financial valuation methods do not directly apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Historically, various approaches have been attempted:

### Past Valuation Methodologies
*   **MV=PQ (Equation of Exchange)**: This monetary theory focuses on money supply (M) and its velocity (V) equaling price (P) times output (Q), or nominal GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Popular in 2016-2017 for Ethereum, this method has since fallen out of favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   **Stock-to-Flow (S2F)**: Popularized by Bitcoiners, this model assumes that scarcity, measured by the ratio of existing supply to annual issuance, directly drives value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. It draws comparisons to gold, where demand isn't met with an increasing flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. However, S2F is criticized for being supply-side focused and assuming infinite, persistent demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. It has not held up well as a predictive model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   **Relative Valuation (Gold TAM)**: A more current approach for Bitcoin involves comparing its market capitalization to the Total Addressable Market (TAM) of gold (around $18 trillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. The idea is to estimate what percentage of gold's value Bitcoin can capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. Bitcoin bulls even suggest digital versions should eventually exceed their analog counterparts in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:40]</a>.

### The Problem with REV and DCF for L1 Tokens
Currently, a common consensus view among analysts is that Bitcoin is a "special snowflake" to be valued like gold, while other L1 assets should be valued using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model based on "Revenue (REV)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

*   **REV Definition**: REV measures the total fees users pay to L1 validators, representing the value validators capture from transaction activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.
*   **DCF Application**: Analysts interpret REV as company cash flows, feeding it into a DCF model to value L1 tokens like traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. A DCF model determines an asset's present value by summing future cash flows and applying a discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

However, this approach is fundamentally flawed for L1 tokens:
*   **Not Company Shares**: L1 tokens are not company shares and do not accrue value in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
*   **Circular Reference**: Validators earn fees in the native token (e.g., ETH for Ethereum, SOL for Solana), not a non-native currency like USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. This creates a circular reference where the token's value depends on its own price, making intrinsic valuation difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
*   **Metcalfe's Law**: If a single entity owned the entire supply of an L1 token (e.g., ETH or SOL), its value would be zero because there would be no network of users to generate transactions or pay fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. This highlights that money is a network, and its value is derived from distributed usage, not concentrated ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional company shares, where concentrated ownership doesn't diminish value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

While REV can still be a useful snapshot of current demand for blockchain usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>, it measures payment usage which tends to deflate over time due to scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. DCF models remain appropriate for non-L1 assets like DeFi protocols that generate revenue in non-native currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>.

## L1 Tokens as Money
L1 tokens are best understood as money, accruing value like money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Definition of Money
Money is defined as any asset primarily used to make payments and as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>.
*   **Payments Use Case**: L1 tokens are used for payments for on-chain services and goods, as all transactions on these chains are paid for in the native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>.
*   **Store of Value Use Case**: L1 tokens are used as a store of value through staking (earning yield) and as a deposit asset in DeFi protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>.

L1 cryptocurrencies fit somewhere between nation-state fiat money and commodity money (like gold or copper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. They have an economy and a form of "GDP," requiring "taxes" (fees) in their native unit of account for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The actual usage of these tokens constitutes them as money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

### Emphasis on Store of Value (SOV)
For L1 cryptocurrencies, the store of value use case is considered more significant than the payments use case in driving value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Deflating Transaction Costs**: The cost of transactions on blockchains continually deflates due to rapid scaling (e.g., 100-500% year-over-year increases in blockspace supply) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This deflation negates the value accrual from payment adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **SOV Demand vs. Supply**: In contrast, demand for the store of value use case for L1 tokens (like Ether, with its low inflation rate of ~0.5% or deflationary status when staked) is not met with a proportional increase in token supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This limited supply response to demand growth is what drives price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Realized Store of Value (RSOV)
To address the unique valuation challenge of L1 tokens as money, the **Realized Store of Value (RSOV)** metric has been proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:59:00">[045:59:00]</a>.

### What is RSOV?
RSOV tracks the two primary drivers of store of value use and demand for L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[046:11:00]</a>:
1.  **Realized Value of L1 Tokens Staked**: The aggregate cost basis of tokens actively staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36:00">[046:36:00]</a>.
2.  **Realized Value of L1 Tokens in DeFi**: The aggregate cost basis of tokens deposited and used in DeFi protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:39:00">[046:39:00]</a>.

*   **Inspired by Bitcoin's Realized Cap**: RSOV adapts the concept of Bitcoin's "realized cap," which measures the last price at which each Bitcoin moved on the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[046:51:00]</a>. Realized cap serves as a proxy for the aggregate cost basis of the entire network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:31:00">[050:31:00]</a>. Similarly, RSOV measures the aggregate cost basis for specific use cases (staking and DeFi) of smart contract platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[051:26:00]</a>.
*   **Measuring Inflows**: RSOV acts as a "net daily inflows metric," using the U.S. dollar value of transactions at the time they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:58:00">[046:58:00]</a>. It fundamentally measures the net inflows of dollars into the network that are "staying in the network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[035:47:00]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Insight**: It quantifies the "buy and hold" or "hoarding" behavior of users, which defines the store of value use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:32:00">[048:32:00]</a>. When users stake ETH or deposit it into DeFi protocols, they are using it as a store of value asset, and RSOV increases based on the price at which the ETH was acquired and locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:54:00">[051:54:00]</a>.

### RSOV vs. Market Cap and REV
*   **Market Cap Premium**: The difference between an L1 token's market cap and its RSOV indicates how much future growth the market has priced in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. A high price-to-RSOV ratio (e.g., SUI at 185x) suggests significant bullish expectation for future SOV usage and inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.
*   **REV's Role**: REV (transaction fees) is elegantly captured within RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. When users pay high gas fees (REV), it represents a transfer of the native L1 asset from "spenders" to "stakers" (validators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>. If validators hold and compound these earnings, the realized value of staked tokens increases, contributing to RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. Thus, REV acts as a "hastening transfer from spenders to savers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.

### Drivers of RSOV Growth
Factors that increase RSOV for an L1 asset include:
*   **Inflows into Staking**: Higher staking yields attract more capital, increasing staked value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>. A market perception of lower risk for an asset can also lead to increased demand for its yield, even compressing the yield as more capital flows in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.
*   **Inflows into DeFi**: More usage of the native token as a deposit asset for collateral or liquidity in DeFi protocols increases its realized value in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:53">[01:20:53]</a>. Growing asset issuance across the network (e.g., more stablecoins or tokenized BTC) provides more pairing opportunities for the native L1 token in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.
*   **Monetary Attributes**: Reliable issuance policy, hardened protocol rules, and easy-to-verify chains enhance the appeal of digital crypto money relative to analog physical government money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.

Conversely, issues like censorship can reduce RSOV. For example, if a chain's validators freeze funds, it undermines its status as a non-sovereign store of value, making it "bad money" and potentially leading to outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>.

## Total Addressable Market for Digital Non-Sovereign Money
The total addressable market (TAM) for digital non-sovereign money is significant. When comparing digital crypto money to analog and government base money, there's a potential 20x upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:00">[1:17:00]</a>. The current digital crypto market cap is around $2.5 trillion, compared to $45 trillion in analog and government-based money (including gold, USD, EUR, JPY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:00">[1:06:00]</a>.

This indicates that the market for cryptocurrencies as money and store of value is still in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:00">[1:19:00]</a>. The ongoing "crisis" in traditional fiat money systems may accelerate the shift towards digital, autonomous, and transparent monetary systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:00">[1:08:00]</a>.

While Bitcoin has been a "Trojan horse" in attracting demand for non-government money due to its perceived immutability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:50">[1:08:50]</a>, other L1 assets like Ethereum are maturing and offer similar, if not superior, monetary attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:50">[1:08:50]</a>. The argument is that all L1 tokens accrue value in the same fundamental way—through net inflows into their store of value use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:00">[1:04:00]</a>.

## [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | Ethereum]]'s Position
[[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | Ethereum]] aims to be both a platform for decentralized applications (generating fees/REV) and a strong store of value asset (growing RSOV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:29:13">[1:29:13]</a>. Its unique position can be seen as a synergy between these roles:
*   High [[impact_of_monetary_policy_on_cryptocurrencies | REV]] (fees) leads to higher staking yields, attracting more stakers and increasing [[crypto_as_a_hedge_against_monetary_policy_shifts | RSOV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:37">[1:10:37]</a>.
*   Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) from staking can be used in DeFi, further driving inflows into DeFi and increasing RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:07">[1:11:07]</a>.
*   Layer 2 scaling solutions (L2s) can enhance user experience, leading to more ETH purchases for SOV use cases, while future L2 designs (e.g., base rollups) may ensure the Layer 1 maintains its revenue streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:28">[1:00:28]</a>.

Relative to Bitcoin, [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | Ethereum]] is considered undervalued, with a market cap around 15% of Bitcoin's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:39:21">[1:39:21]</a>. Its strong monetary attributes (censorship resistance, low inflation, dominance in on-chain finance) suggest a higher probability of it reaching a comparable monetary asset status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:40:17">[1:40:17]</a>.

## Future of L1 Valuation
The RSOV framework is a "V1 version" and aims for continuous improvement with input from analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:41:41">[1:41:41]</a>. The goal is to identify and measure all measurable store of value usage of L1 tokens, including potential factors like ETF inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:34:51">[1:34:51]</a>. The emphasis remains on a data-driven, fundamental, and chain-agnostic approach to understand the true drivers of value for these monetary assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:38:16">[1:38:16]</a>.

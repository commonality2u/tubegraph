The Bankless Nation podcast recently hosted a discussion dissecting the "Ethereum Pivot" and its implications for the ETH asset and the broader crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">00:00:04</a>. This conversation stemmed from a tweet by H stating, "If they can pull this off and buy back some credibility, this may be the beginning of the [[reasons_for_ethereums_recent_price_rally | ETH revival]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">00:02:26</a>.

## The "Ethereum Pivot" Tagline

The core of the discussion revolved around the proposed tagline for the [[Ethereums strategic pivot and future potential | Ethereum pivot]]: "scale the layer one, scale blobs, improve UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">00:02:17</a>.

*   **Positive Reception**: John Charbano, a crypto researcher, rated the tagline "10 out of 10," agreeing that its successful execution could be a "meaningful turn" for both [[Ethereums strategic pivot and future potential | Ethereum]] and ETH as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">00:02:51</a>. He noted the interesting ordering of priorities: scaling the L1 before scaling blobs, which aligns with his preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">00:03:10</a>.
*   **Blob Misunderstanding**: Some, like DeFi Llama creator ox ngmi, misinterpreted the blob scaling as "rugging the rollup road map," implying it would negatively impact L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">00:03:36</a>. Brett highlighted that blobs are for rollups and cannot be used by L1 users directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">00:03:48</a>. This demonstrates how [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | Ethereum detractors]] will find ways to be negative even when progress is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">00:04:20</a>.

## L1 Scaling and the "Death of Longtail Layer 2s"

The discussion quickly moved to the implications of [[ethereum_scaling_and_strategic_pivot | L1 scaling]] for Layer 2s (L2s), specifically the "death of Longtail layer 2s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">00:03:11</a>.

*   **"Rugging" L2s**: Scaling the L1 means it will attract users for high-value DeFi, potentially taking users away from some L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">00:05:12</a>. John argued that L2s that aren't "meaningfully different" from mainnet will likely "die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">00:05:30</a>.
*   **Unsustainable L2s**: Several L2s are currently operating at a net loss, meaning the cost of posting data to L1 outweighs the fees generated from user activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">00:06:00</a>.
*   **L2 Mania**: The proliferation of L2s was partly a "mania" where projects launched L2s just because it was the "meta," not for a "real purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">00:06:47</a>. This led to front-running future demand that didn't materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">00:09:05</a>.
*   **No Complaints from Major L2s**: Notably, no major, successful L2s have publicly expressed concern about L1 scaling competing with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">00:07:26</a>. This suggests that truly differentiated L2s feel secure.
*   **Future of L2s**: While the vision of "a thousand million jillion L2s" was once popular, the future number of L2s will correlate to the demand for compute, potentially including ephemeral L2s that spin up for momentary demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">00:08:40</a>. John believes L1 scaling won't fundamentally alter the long-run need for chains, as today's "long tail of chains" isn't serving unique, high-scale use cases but rather offering "another EVM blockchain with like 1-second block times that does the same stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">00:09:57</a>.

## Optimism's Superchain Model and Interoperability

Optimism's Superchain model, which takes a 10% rake of all fees, was seen by some as "running interception on like what [[Ethereums strategic pivot and its implications | Ethereum]] was trying to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">00:10:31</a>.

*   **Microcosm of Ethereum**: Optimism's focus on building a unified network of chains (like Base and World Chain) was an attempt to achieve [[Ethereum Development and Market Positioning | Ethereum's vision]] for itself, but through more centralized coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">00:11:01</a>. This was partly driven by the perceived "weakness of the layer 1" in terms of interoperability and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">00:11:32</a>.
*   **L1 Scaling's Impact**: John still believes L1 scaling won't fundamentally change Optimism's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">00:11:51</a>. Optimism's value comes from its shared governance, bridge management, and opinionated technical interoperability, which are different from what [[shift_in_focus_of_the_ethereum_tech_stack | Ethereum L1]] is trying to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">00:12:02</a>.

## ETH Value Accrual and Narratives

The conversation broadened to the debate around ETH's value accrual and how to position it in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">00:18:50</a>.

*   **Conflicting Views**:
    *   **Brett's Blend**: Argues for a blend of fee generation (usefulness) and "moneyiness properties." You need "fees to generate like the basil level of like bullishness for a chain" and then allow the community to "dream higher" by displaying properties like censorship resistance and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">00:20:32</a>.
    *   **John's Tech-First Approach**: Believes focusing less on economics is key for ETH to win as "sovereign money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">00:23:07</a>. He thinks economic arguments against Bitcoin are a "game that you will you will just always lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">00:23:08</a>. For John, ETH wins by being the "winning tech platform," where "everything is built on Ethereum" and it's the "censorship resistant programmable asset at the center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">00:23:45</a>. He also noted that [[reasons_for_ethereums_recent_price_rally | ETH's recent price rally]] has lagged due to the ecosystem falling behind on usage compared to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">00:25:40</a>.
*   **The "Money Cult"**: The idea of meme-ing ETH into existence as a "global reserve asset" was discussed, but it was noted that people often interpret [[ethereum_price_surge_and_crypto_market_trends | ETH's nature]] based on their own biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">00:19:41</a>.
*   **Dominance and Monetary Premium**: The panel agreed that ETH's monetary premium may have deflated as its dominance as a smart contract platform decreased from 90% to around 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">00:27:51</a>. The presence of a "second best" contender like Solana commoditizes the smart contract platform space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">00:28:02</a>.

## Chain Neutrality and Memecoin Mania

Andy, from a trader's perspective, never cared for the "ETH is money" narrative, being drawn to Ethereum for its tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">00:28:37</a>.

*   **Following the Activity**: Andy shifted transactions from Ethereum mainnet to Solana because that's "where things continued to happen" and "the majority of opportunities have been over the last couple years," especially with the rise of Pump Fun and memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">00:29:50</a>.
*   **"Chain Neutral" Traders**: Many traders are "chain neutral," gravitating to "whatever layer 1 asset is giving them the opportunities to have fun casino games and and potentially make money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">00:30:33</a>. This "fun" creates a "valuation premium" or "moneyiness" for the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">00:30:51</a>.
*   **Denominated Asset**: Whether it was ETH for ICOs, DeFi, or NFTs, or SOL for memecoins, the dominant chain becomes the "denominator asset" for speculative fervor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">00:33:41</a>. The buy pressure comes from people needing the asset to participate in the "next cool thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">00:32:01</a>.
*   **Memecoin Sustainability**: The "sniper problem" (bots buying tokens in the same block as launch) is a major issue for memecoin sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">00:35:30</a>. While L2s with centralized sequencers offer some protection from sandwich attacks, Pump Fun on Solana still sees 80% of launches having same-block initial buys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">00:36:00</a>.
*   **Human Psychology**: Despite highly publicized blowups and clearly bad odds, memecoin trading remains sticky due to the perception that ordinary people can get rich, unlike traditional casinos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">00:43:30</a>. While initial "casuals" may have left, the current market consists of "sophisticated" players who understand the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">00:45:51</a>.

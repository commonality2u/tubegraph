From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The start of 2025 brings a curated list of predictions from various thought leaders in the crypto space, offering insights into potential market shifts, technological advancements, and regulatory changes for the year ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Market and Economic Outlook

### SPX at 7,500 Driven by AI
Vance Spencer of Framework Ventures predicts that the S&P 500 (SPX) will reach 7,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This bullish outlook is tied to the expectation that [[predictions_for_ai_and_agi_development_by_2027 | AI]] will deliver on its promises in the traditional fintech equities space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. The current crypto bull market is happening in parallel with an [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI]] bull market in the traditional financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This suggests a bullish year for stocks, primarily led by major [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI]] stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### Stablecoin Market Cap Hits $500 Billion
D from Blockworks predicts that the stablecoin market cap will reach $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, up from its current $210 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. This forecast includes the possibility of companies like Stripe or Robinhood launching their own stablecoins, and Walmart or Amazon beginning to accept stablecoins for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. The expectation is that a stablecoin bill could even pass in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

### Increased Risk-Taking Due to Deficit Spending
Coinbase predicts that the next administration's projected deficit spending, if it materializes, will lead to greater risk-taking in crypto as more dollars circulate in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. This implies a "risk-on" environment for 2025, where government spending and potential inflation will drive up crypto and other risk assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

### US Re-emerges as Dominant Crypto Hub
Mike Epo predicts that the US will re-emerge as the dominant global hub for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. This involves founders moving back and opening offices in New York, and US crypto conferences becoming larger than their Asian counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

### Bitcoin on Balance Sheets
Galaxy Digital predicts that five NASDAQ 100 companies and five nation-states will announce the addition of Bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.

## Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics

### Crypto Splits into Two Major Verticals
Deli Digital Crypt forecasts a split in crypto into two major verticals, sidelining everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>:

1.  **Web3 Natives**: Traders deeply embedded in the crypto market with a nuanced understanding, engaging in high-risk trading including memecoins, [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI agents]], and pre-sales, reminiscent of the "Wild West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
2.  **Regular Investors**: Institutional and retail investors with more fundamental investment and trading strategies, viewing crypto as an alternative to the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

The prediction also suggests that early-stage DeFi, Real World Assets (RWAs), and DePIN protocols that don't secure leading positions will be sidelined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

### AI Agents Dominance
Tommy from Deli Digital predicts that [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI agent]]-driven transactions will constitute 10% of all on-chain transactions by the end of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Currently, this figure is likely less than 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

There will also be a wave of adoption by San Francisco traditional [[predictions_for_ai_and_agi_development_by_2027 | AI]] developers into crypto [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI]], drawn by tokens that offer the ability to break out of Web2 [[predictions_for_ai_and_agi_development_by_2027 | AI]] labs and raise capital and community overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

### AI Agent Platform in Top 10 Crypto by Market Cap
EZ, an [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI]] expert, predicts that an [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI agent]] platform will enter the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. This requires a market cap of over $35 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Virtuals, a leading [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI agent]] platform, is currently at $4.4 billion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, implying a potential 10x growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

### TikTok Turning Videos into Meme Coins
Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures predicts that TikTok will turn all videos into meme coins that can be traded on decentralized exchanges globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. While the specific mention of TikTok is notable, this could also apply to any large social media entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

### Ethereum Price Prediction
A base case prediction for [[future_price_predictions_and_expectations_for_ethereum | Ethereum]] is $10,000 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. A more optimistic scenario suggests $15,000 to $20,000 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. This bullish outlook is supported by increasing blob space usage, rising fees and revenue, and the heating up of the [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI meta]] across Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. The impact of institutional buyers and [[market_trends_in_crypto_and_ethereum | Ethereum]] ETFs is also expected to propel the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.

### Crypto AI Agents Dominating the Meta
A consensus prediction from Bankless is that [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | crypto AI agents]] will dominate the 2025 meta and reach a market cap of $250 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. Currently, the [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI agents]] sector is around $17.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. This narrative is anticipated to experience a surge similar to DeFi in previous cycles, potentially leading to over-inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

> [!info] Note on Predictions
> These predictions should be taken with a grain of salt, as market dynamics can be unpredictable. Often, the most impactful events are those that were not widely foreseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.

## Key Developments to Watch

### IRS Regulations and DeFi KYC
The IRS finalized a tax rule during the holidays requiring all DeFi "brokers" to collect user trading information, which could lead to a de facto AML/KYC requirement for DeFi front ends starting in 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. This stems from vague language in the 2021 Biden infrastructure bill regarding broker reporting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Implications for DeFi
> If this rule is upheld, DeFi front ends would need to implement full signup processes, collecting names, addresses, and Social Security information from users, similar to centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>. Alternatively, they might block US users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a> or move towards more decentralized, fee-less models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

The crypto industry is actively fighting back, with lawsuits already filed against the IRS, arguing that the agency overstepped its authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. There is also the possibility of the incoming Trump administration reversing these regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>.

### [[future_trends_in_blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_ecosystems | Ethereum Upgrades]] in 2025
The "Petra" hard fork, expected in 2025, will include several key EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>:
*   **Max EB (Max Effective Balance)**: Allows [[future_trends_in_blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_ecosystems | Ethereum]] validators to have more than 32 ETH, consolidating multiple validators into one and reducing messaging overhead, thereby improving scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.
*   **Account Abstraction for EOA Wallets**: Enables externally owned accounts (EOAs) to act like account-abstracted wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>.
*   **Blob Throughput Increase**: Doubles blob space from an average of three to six, along with increasing call data costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.

Notably, Pias (data availability sampling), a massive 10x upgrade to blob space, is not expected in Petra and will likely be part of the "Fusaka" hard fork in late 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

### MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Acceleration Plan
MicroStrategy is looking to accelerate its "2121 Bitcoin plan," which involved investing $42 billion through debt instruments and equity to expand its Bitcoin holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. Shareholders will vote on speeding up these capital-raising efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.

### Do Kwon's Extradition
Do Kwon, founder of Terra-Luna, is being extradited to the United States after Montenegro's Justice Minister signed the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>. He was the subject of a tug-of-war between South Korea and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.

### Vitalik Buterin Adopts a Hippo
Vitalik Buterin has sponsored Mudang, a pygmy hippopotamus, with a donation of 10,000 TBH (approximately $300,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>. He further allocated 88 ETH for Mudang and her friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>. This action aligns with a strategy of using meme coin proceeds for charitable donations, creating an alignment between Vitalik's philanthropic goals and the meme coin community's desire for acknowledgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.

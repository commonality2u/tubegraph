From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Every [[layer_1_tokens_and_traditional_assets | Layer 1 blockchain]] possesses a native token, commonly referred to as a Layer 1 token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The fundamental question for investors and analysts is how to effectively value these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Understanding the drivers of returns for these tokens is crucial for evaluating risks and making informed investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A robust valuation framework enables comparison between different blockchains, such as Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, on an "apples to apples" basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Layer 1 tokens constitute the vast majority of the total crypto market capitalization, accounting for approximately 95% of the over $3 trillion market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This includes significant assets like Bitcoin (around 63% of the total, or ~2-2.3 trillion), Ethereum (around $350 billion), Solana, Sui, and Bit Tensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The way these tokens are valued essentially defines the valuation of the entire crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Historical Valuation Methodologies

The crypto industry has continuously grappled with the "trillion-dollar question" of how to value cryptocurrencies, as traditional valuation methods often fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### MV=PQ (Quantity Theory of Money)
Early attempts in 2016-2017 applied the Quantity Theory of Money (MV=PQ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This monetary theory posits that money supply (M) multiplied by its velocity (V, rate of spending) must equal price (P) times output (Q, nominal GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. While initially exciting, this model has largely fallen out of favor for valuing Layer 1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Stock-to-Flow
Popularized by Bitcoiners, [[fundamentals_and_crypto_valuation_techniques | Stock-to-Flow]] (S2F) is based on the assumption that scarcity, measured by the ratio of existing supply to annual issuance, directly drives value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It draws parallels with gold, where demand is not met with an increasing "flow" of new supply, making it price-sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. However, S2F is primarily a supply-side metric and assumes infinite, persistent demand, which is not always the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Bitcoin's S2F model has not held up well over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Relative Valuation to Gold
A more recent and "directionally correct" approach for Bitcoin is a relative valuation to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This involves comparing Bitcoin's market cap to gold's (e.g., $18 trillion) and estimating what percentage of this "non-state store of value" market Bitcoin can capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Bitcoin bulls argue that the digital version of an asset should eventually exceed the value of its analog counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This line of thinking can be extended to other Layer 1 assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Critiquing Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and REV for L1s

A current consensus view suggests that Bitcoin is a "special snowflake" and can be valued against gold, while all other Layer 1 assets should be valued differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This "something else" is often based on revenue (REV) metrics, applied in a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### What is REV?
REV measures the total fees users pay to Layer 1 validators, or the value validators capture from transaction activity on the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Analysts interpret REV as "company cash flows" and feed it into a DCF model to value Layer 1 tokens like traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Why DCF/REV is Problematic for L1 Tokens
The core issue is that [[difference_between_layer_1_tokens_and_traditional_assets | Layer 1 tokens]] are not company shares and do not accrue value in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Native Yield:** Validators do not collect revenue in a non-native currency (like USDC). They earn more of their own token (e.g., ETH, SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. A traditional DCF works because an asset (like Apple stock) compounds non-native assets, meaning its value is independent of its own price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. For L1 tokens, the circular reference of earning more of their own token makes traditional DCF ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Network Effect:** A mental test reveals the flaw: if one wallet owned the entire supply of a company's shares, its value wouldn't change. However, if one wallet owned the entire supply of ETH, SOL, or BTC, its value would be zero because there would be no one to pay fees or conduct transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This highlights that L1 tokens derive value from their network effect, a concept ignored by DCF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   **Misleading Conversion:** While REV measures aggregate dollar value paid for transactions, users pay in the native token (ETH, SOL, BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. The implied conversion to dollars for DCF models "muddies the waters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Incomplete Demand Picture:** REV only measures demand for L1 tokens for payments/transactions, missing a crucial "store of value" demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Fees Trend to Zero:** As [[scaling_the_layer_1_blockchain | blockchains scale]] (e.g., [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Ethereum's Layer 1 scaling]] with ZK rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>), the supply of blockspace expands massively (e.g., 100x for Ethereum Layer 1 and Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>). This deflation in transaction costs effectively negates growth from payments from a value accrual perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. While transaction ordering (MEV) might provide a durable source of revenue due to a fundamental limit on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>, in aggregate, staking yields (a native yield) are expected to compress over time as demand for non-government money increases and risk decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

> "Valuing the Layer 1 token using sort of REV as a DCF for the value that's captured by the validators is like trying to value Apple on how much Apple shares it collected from its own users. It fundamentally is not an intrinsic valuation metric." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>

REV remains a useful snapshot of current demand to use a blockchain, allowing for cross-chain comparison when swapped to a shared currency like the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. DCF and REV are appropriate for valuing non-Layer 1 assets, such as DeFi protocols, which generate cash flows in non-native currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

## Layer 1 Tokens as Money

Layer 1 tokens are fundamentally money, not company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   **Definition of Money:** Money is any asset primarily used for payments and as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **L1s Fit the Definition:**
    *   **Payments:** All transactions on Layer 1 blockchains are paid for in the native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. No transaction can be confirmed in any other token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
    *   **Store of Value (SOV):** L1 tokens are used for staking (taking duration risk for yield, similar to bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a> and as deposit assets in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

L1 tokens, especially smart contract networks like Ethereum, occupy a middle ground between nation-state fiat money and commodity money (like gold or copper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. They have an economy and a "GDP" where users pay "taxes" (transaction fees) in the native unit of account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. The actual usage of these tokens determines their monetary status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

### Payments vs. Store of Value
While L1 tokens are used for payments, the **store of value** use case is the primary driver of value for these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. This is because the supply of L1 tokens for the store of value use case (e.g., ETH inflation of 0-2% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>) is relatively constrained compared to the rapidly expanding supply of blockspace for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. In the SOV use case, demand growth is not met with more supply, leading to price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

## Realized Store of Value (RSOV)

A new framework, **Realized Store of Value (RSOV)**, is proposed as a more holistic metric for valuing Layer 1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

### Definition of RSOV
RSOV tracks the two primary drivers of store of value demand for Layer 1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>:
1.  The realized value of Layer 1 tokens **staked** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.
2.  The realized value of Layer 1 tokens **in DeFi** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

RSOV is inspired by Bitcoin's "realized cap" metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. Realized cap for Bitcoin is the sum of all Bitcoins valued at the price they last moved on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. It represents the aggregate cost basis of the entire network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. RSOV adapts this principle to smart contract platforms by measuring the aggregate cost basis specifically for tokens staked and tokens used in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.

RSOV is a fundamental measure of net inflows in dollar terms that accumulate to the Layer 1 token over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. Activities like staking and using tokens in DeFi for yield, collateral, or hedging represent "buying and holding" behavior, which is the key action RSOV measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.

### RSOV and REV Relationship
RSOV elegantly incorporates REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. When users transact on a network and pay fees in the native token, and validators hold and compound these earnings (rather than selling), the realized value of staked tokens increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. Therefore, REV grows RSOV "one block at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>. High REV indicates a faster transfer of the L1 asset from spenders to savers/stakers, thus contributing to RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.

### Interpreting the Price to RSOV Ratio
The ratio of an L1 token's market cap to its RSOV reveals what future growth the market has currently priced in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.
*   **Example (Sui):** A high ratio, like Sui's 185x (price to RSOV), indicates that its market cap is significantly higher than the actual usage of Sui as a store of value asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. This means investors are making a very large bet on the future growth of Sui's store of value usage (staking, DeFi, other applications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>. It suggests the asset is "expensive as a store of value," with future SOV properties largely baked into the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Bitcoin:** For Bitcoin, when its market cap trades below its realized cap, historically, it's considered a strong buying opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>. RSOV aims to provide a similar "bottom floor" valuation for smart contract L1s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

### Drivers of RSOV Growth
Factors that increase RSOV for a Layer 1 asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>:
*   **Inflows into Staking:** Driven by higher staking yields or a change in market perception, where the asset is viewed as lower risk, attracting more inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
*   **Inflows into DeFi:** Increased use of the asset as collateral, for liquidity provision, or other deposit functions within DeFi protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.
*   **Growing Asset Issuance on the Network:** L1 tokens are often paired with other assets (stablecoins, tokenized BTC) in DeFi. More such assets becoming available on-chain can lead to increased usage of the L1 token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>.
*   **Monetary Attributes:** Reliable issuance policy, hardened protocol rules, and ease of chain verification highlight the strengths of digital crypto money compared to analog/government money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.

The yield on staking (e.g., 3.5% for ETH) is secondary to the investor's core bet: the long-term growth of demand for the asset as money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>. A higher yield might also indicate the market perceives a higher risk associated with the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.

### Layer 2s and RSOV
The debate about whether Layer 2s are "parasitic" or "synergistic" with Layer 1s often centers on revenue metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. However, from an RSOV perspective, if a Layer 2 imports or utilizes a Layer 1 token (e.g., Ether for lending platforms or trading pairs), it increases the Layer 1's RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. People buying and using ETH in DeFi on Base or Arbitrum, for instance, contribute to ETH's realized value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. The [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | role of Layer 1 and Layer 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem]] is complex. While initial Layer 2s might have reduced Layer 1 sequencing fees and compressed staking yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>, new [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | Layer 2 infrastructures]] (like "base rollups") can onboard new capital, increasing demand for the Layer 1 token as a store of value, while the Layer 1 itself continues to [[scaling_the_layer_1_blockchain | scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

## Total Addressable Market (TAM)

Recognizing Layer 1 tokens as money unlocks an exciting [[difference_between_layer_1_tokens_and_traditional_assets | Total Addressable Market]] (TAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. When compared to analog and government-based money (gold, fiat currencies), the potential upside is significant. The digital non-sovereign money market currently stands at around $2.5 trillion, while analog and government-based money (defined as physically printed cash and real bank reserves) totals about $45 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. This represents a potential 20x upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.

Bitcoin is seen as a "Trojan horse" in this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>, as investors look for diversification away from risks in traditional government money systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Over time, other crypto assets like ETH are expected to mature and become more reliable, transparent, and autonomous monetary systems, rivaling Bitcoin's value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

> "If we want to be bullish about crypto as an industry, we want to look to the digital non-sovereign money comps rather than DCF comps." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>

## L1 Tokens: Commodities, Not Companies

The assertion that if there's a cash flow, it should be valued based on cash flows, is a "lazy assertion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:38">[01:32:38]</a>. Validators are paid in their native token (e.g., more ETH, not dollars), which is a native yield, not company cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. Applying DCF to an asset that is money is trying to fit a "square peg in a round hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:45">[01:33:45]</a>. Many traditional assets, such as gold, oil, or fiat currencies (like the Euro), cannot be valued using DCF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>. Layer 1 tokens, fundamentally, are commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:25">[01:38:25]</a>.

### Tribalism and Ethereum's Position
The crypto community often exhibits tribalism, with Bitcoin maxis preferring to strip utility from the blockchain to maximize its [[impact_of_staking_and_defi_on_token_value | store of value]] emphasis, seeing revenue as a dilution of its monetary base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. Conversely, other Layer 1 ecosystems (like Solana) emphasize growing revenue and fees for blockspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>. [[ethereums_challenges_in_the_layer_1_smart_contract_space | Ethereum]], however, aims to achieve both: being a Layer 1 store of value while also having a burn mechanism linked to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. This dual nature can be perplexing to those who prefer simple, singular valuation models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

The RSOV framework is a "V1 version" and seeks further input from analysts to identify additional measurable store of value usage (e.g., ETF inflows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The aim is to improve the quality of the signal and make the data more accessible and reliable for the broader community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:29">[01:36:29]</a>.

From an RSOV lens, Ethereum appears "really, really undervalued" compared to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>. Its potential to surpass Bitcoin as a monetary asset is seen as much higher than its current 15% market cap relative to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>. Upcoming catalysts like real-time proving and base rollup opportunities, alongside efforts to [[scaling_the_layer_1_blockchain | scale the Layer 1]] and shorten block times, could significantly increase ETH staking yield and attract more inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>. Ethereum's monetary attributes, such as censorship resistance, low inflation, and its role as a base asset for 85% of on-chain finance (EVM), further differentiate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>.

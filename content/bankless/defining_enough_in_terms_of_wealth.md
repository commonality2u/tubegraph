Throughout discussions on "crypto wealth," a crucial element often overlooked is the personal definition of "enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The speaker had never previously defined a specific financial threshold that would signify sufficient resources for all personal and family desires, allowing for the provision of loved ones without constantly monitoring a financial "scoreboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

This pursuit of "enough" does not stem from greed, but rather from an enjoyment of the "game" of growing a business and investing wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For the speaker, it's not about acquiring flashy [[the_societal_perception_of_success_and_net_worth | status symbols]] like luxury cars, but more akin to achieving a "high score" in an arcade game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The importance of defining this number, especially with a spouse, was a significant missing piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## A Broader Perspective on Wealth

A significant realization was that the initial [[broader_definition_of_wealth_beyond_net_worth | definition of wealth]] was too narrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Primarily, wealth was equated with net worth, which, while a key component, is also heavily influenced by societal expectations that define success as a rising net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

However, financial wealth is only one aspect of [[different_types_of_wealth | different types of wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A more comprehensive understanding includes:
*   Time wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Relationships and social wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Mental wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Physical wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

Recognizing these additional categories led to the understanding that the speaker was "completely overallocated" in financial wealth, neglecting the other four types of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[balancing_financial_and_nonfinancial_wealth | balancing financial and nonfinancial wealth]].

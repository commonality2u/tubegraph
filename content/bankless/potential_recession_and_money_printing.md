The global economy is entering a new phase, marked by potential recession and significant shifts in monetary policy. Current trends suggest a bottoming out of global liquidity, followed by a new cycle of increased money supply, particularly in response to economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Global Liquidity Cycles

According to a chart put out by Ralph Paul, global M2 (a measure of money supply) is a key indicator for global liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:04]</a>. The world has recently been through a cycle of decreasing global monetary liquidity across fiat systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:12]</a>. This cycle has now bottomed out, and a new one is beginning, with M2 projected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:18]</a>. Ralph Paul conceptualizes these as four-year liquidity cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Impending Economic Shifts

Economist Ray Dalio has articulated that fundamental changes are underway, signalling the brink of a [[implications_of_a_new_monetary_order | new monetary order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. He suggests that domestic political and international world orders are breaking down due to unsustainable fundamentals that are easily measurable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:46]</a>.

Key imbalances contributing to this shift include:
*   China's reliance on United States debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   The United States' reliance on Chinese manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:01:00]</a>.

Rectifying these trade imbalances is expected to cause significant economic pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Role of Money Printing

In the event of a [[the_potential_for_a_recession_and_global_economic_shifts | recession]] or American capital flight, the "[[money_printing_and_economic_policy | money printers]] are going to turn on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:30]</a>. There is little incentive for governments *not* to [[money_printing_and_economic_policy | print a bunch of money]] to ease the pain caused by these economic adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:09]</a>.

This strategy of [[money_printing_and_economic_policy | printing money]] to mitigate suffering is anticipated to devalue fiat currencies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:19]</a>. This aligns with the long-standing "Bitcoiner thesis" regarding [[impact_of_monetary_policy_on_cryptocurrencies | monetary policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:23]</a>.

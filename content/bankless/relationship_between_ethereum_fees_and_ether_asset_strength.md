A shift in focus towards making the Ethereum tech stack a strong product is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift is believed to have a positive feedback signal back to [[economic_importance_of_ether_as_an_asset | Ether the asset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Strengthening Ether as an Asset
[[economic_importance_of_ether_as_an_asset | Ether the asset]] is pursuing its goal of becoming a [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset | commodity asset]] with a [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset | commodity-like shelling point]] and focus, and a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] focus by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This objective is bolstered by Ethereum's strong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It is suggested that Ethereum, with higher fees and higher burn rates, can boost the strength of [[economic_importance_of_ether_as_an_asset | Ether the asset]] (the commodity money) on the technology side of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Differentiated Community Stance
There is a need for a nuanced approach within the community when discussing Ethereum:
*   **Ethereum (the Product/Technology)**: The community needs to be adaptable, flexible, open, and pragmatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This approach can be described as having [[convexity_in_ethereum_technology_and_concavity_in_ether_asset_approach | convexity]] in the style of Vitalik Buterin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. When engaging with application builders who are choosing a home to build, a pragmatic stance is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **[[economic_importance_of_ether_as_an_asset | Ether (the Asset)]]**: Discussions about [[economic_importance_of_ether_as_an_asset | Ether the asset]] should shift to be maximalist, strong, and unforgiving, embodying [[convexity_in_ethereum_technology_and_concavity_in_ether_asset_approach | concavity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. When discussing [[economic_importance_of_ether_as_an_asset | Ether the asset]] with entities like Wall Street, a "yachty maximalist" approach is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

The challenge for the ecosystem is to be in both lanes simultaneously, adapting the context to the moment in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This dual approach is seen as daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

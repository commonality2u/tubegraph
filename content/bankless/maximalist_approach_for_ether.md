From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

A significant shift in focus is observed within the [[Ethereum development priorities | Ethereum]] tech stack, aiming for it to become a very strong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This development is seen as providing positive feedback to [[role_of_ether_as_a_commodity_and_financial_asset | Ether]] as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

[[Ether as a commodity asset | Ether]] is intended to be a commodity asset with a commodity-like shelling point and focus, as well as a store of value. This is further bolstered by the strength of [[Ethereum development priorities | Ethereum]] as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is believed that [[Ethereum development priorities | Ethereum]], with higher fees and increased burning, can enhance the strength of [[Ether as a commodity asset | Ether]] as a commodity currency within the technology side of [[Ethereum development priorities | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Dual Nature of Ethereum and Ether

The [[maximalism_and_nationalism_in_the_ethereum_community | Ethereum community]] faces a challenge in balancing two seemingly contradictory stances:

### Maximalism for Ether the Asset
When discussing [[Ether as a commodity asset | Ether]] as an asset, there's a need for a "concavity," "extreme," and "maximalist" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This implies being strong, unforgiving, and yachty maximalist, especially when communicating with entities like Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Flexibility for Ethereum the Product
Conversely, when discussing [[Ethereum development priorities | Ethereum]] as a product, the community needs to be adaptable, flexible, open, and pragmatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This pragmatic approach is crucial when interacting with application builders who are choosing a platform to build upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Challenge of Duality
The core challenge for the [[maximalism_and_nationalism_in_the_ethereum_community | Ethereum ecosystem]] is the difficulty of maintaining both perspectives simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The community must be able to "be in both lanes" and choose the appropriate stance based on the specific context of the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This dual requirement is acknowledged as both scary and daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

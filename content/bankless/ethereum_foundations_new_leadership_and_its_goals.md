The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has appointed two new co-executive directors, Tamas Dziurda (Stanjac) and Shawe Wang, marking a significant [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_changes | shift]] in the organization's leadership structure and strategic focus for the [[ethereums_future_strategic_direction | future]] of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. This [[evolution_of_ethereum_foundation_and_leadership | transition]] aims to provide more operational leadership, accelerate upgrade cadences, and prioritize product mindfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>.

## New Co-Executive Directors

### Shawe Wang
Shawe Wang brings a deep understanding of Ethereum's core protocol, having joined the Foundation in 2017 with a computer science background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. She initially worked as a core protocol researcher on the first version of sharding (the purple concept) and contributed significantly to the consensus protocol, including the transition to Proof of Stake, known as "The Merge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Her role as co-lead of the EF's consensus R&D team involved coordinating between research and client implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. Shawe joined the EF leadership team in December 2023, shifting her focus from technical research to considering the entire [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | ecosystem]] and its impact on users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

### Tamas Dziurda (Stanjac)
Tamas Dziurda's journey with Ethereum began in late 2015 or early 2016, attending a London meetup while working in traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. He founded Nethermind in August 2017, initially intending to build trading solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. However, his deep dive into Ethereum's Yellow Paper led him to implement core components in C#, discovering a passion for infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. Nethermind evolved into a core development and infrastructure company for Ethereum, growing to approximately 300 people and introducing 600 individuals to the [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum ecosystem]] through an internship program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. Tamas also contributed to Flashbots and the Euler project, gaining extensive experience in application building, infrastructure, security, and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. He felt compelled to join the EF because Ethereum was "asking for a bit of help and leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>.

## Role and Vision of the Ethereum Foundation
The [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | role of the Ethereum Foundation]] executive director is not akin to a company CEO, but rather to lead a non-profit organization with a long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>. The EF sees its mission as being a steward of the [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | ecosystem]], stepping up when needed, and empowering other players to contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>.

Tamas aims to inject an "energy of experience" into the EF, focusing on accelerating internal processes and improving communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. He identifies [[changes_in_the_ethereum_foundation_and_community_dynamics | inefficiencies]] and communication problems within the foundation, which he believes are "very much fixable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>. His approach involves empowering team leads within the EF to act as leaders and decision-makers, fostering an environment where talented individuals can communicate more effectively and accelerate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.

Shawe states her personal motto for this role is to "lead with clarity and move with purpose and build without attachment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a>. She emphasizes that the role is not about personal legacy but about contributing to the desired future of Ethereum â€“ a layer one, commercialist blockchain that is also about the culture and the world we want to live in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>. She hopes Ethereum will become the most decentralized, permissionless, and open blockchain globally, balancing growth with core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.

### Community Feedback and Strategic Shift
The community has generally lauded the EF's research and commitment to values like decentralization and open-source collaboration, evident in the diverse client teams worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a>. However, common criticisms have included perceived slowness in accelerating timelines, lack of commitment to deadlines, and insufficient communication regarding the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:31:00">[32:31:00]</a>. There's also a sentiment that the EF can be disconnected from real-world user cases, operating from an "ivory tower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>.

Tamas acknowledges these criticisms, including the need for a clearer "northstar" and faster movement, especially in onboarding founders and collaborating with DeFi builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:22:00">[35:22:00]</a>. He aims to make the EF more responsive and communicative, addressing difficult questions directly rather than avoiding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>. The shift also involves accelerating timelines and pushing for immediate action, rather than waiting for formal meetings or conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:02:00">[51:02:00]</a>.

## Key Objectives and Priorities

The new leadership has outlined three primary [[ethereum_development_priorities | objectives]] for the next 12 months, reflecting a [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | strategic pivot]] towards product-centric development:
1.  **Scaling Ethereum Layer 1 (L1):** This objective emphasizes the need for Ethereum's mainnet to remain strong and competitive, outclassing competitors on quality of research, protocol strength, decentralization, security, and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. The target is a 3x scaling increase this year and a 100x increase over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
2.  **Scaling Blobs for Layer 2s:** This objective reflects continued support for the Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem, which has been a "massive success" in scaling Ethereum and bringing in users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Scaling blobs ensures L2s can continue to borrow security and decentralization from the L1 effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
3.  **Improving User Experience (UX):** This goal addresses concerns about L1 and L2 not feeling like one cohesive chain, focusing on interoperability standards, security, and ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. UX also encompasses "DevX" (developer experience), aiming to provide builders with better tooling, clarity on roadmaps, and support to foster successful and impactful projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. This includes ensuring that products built on Ethereum prioritize user needs and involve stakeholders in the design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

Tamas views the overarching approach as making Ethereum more product-based, where changes and features are driven by user needs and have a clear impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

### Hard Forks and Timelines
The EF plans to accelerate the cadence of hard forks, aiming for every six months, a significant increase from the historical 12-18 month average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>.
*   **Pectra:** Scheduled for May 7th, this fork focuses on UX improvements via EIP-SFS 102 (account abstraction) and changes to staking with max effective balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>.
*   **Fasaka:** Devnets for Fasaka will immediately spawn after Pectra's May 7th release. It is targeted for September or October, demonstrating an intent to accelerate delivery and avoid delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.
*   **Glamsterdam:** Planned for March to June of next year, this fork will continue to focus on L1 scaling acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.

The new leadership believes these problems are "very much fixable" due to the talent within the EF and the broader community's desire for Ethereum to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. They aim to empower internal teams and involve external stakeholders more actively in the decision-making process to drive faster execution and deliver a more cohesive, impactful Ethereum experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

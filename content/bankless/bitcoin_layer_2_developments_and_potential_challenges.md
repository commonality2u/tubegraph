The discussion around [[bitcoins_security_budget_and_roadmap_challenges | Bitcoin's roadmap challenges]] and the emergence of multi-chain architectures has prompted reflection on the lessons learned from [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum's Layer 2 development]]. Eric Wall questioned what insights should be applied when designing a multi-chain roadmap for Bitcoin, especially given its permissionless nature where fractals of past issues might reappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.

## Fundamental Differences: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum L2s

There is a hesitation to directly analogize [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum L2s]] with Bitcoin L2s, largely because the underlying platforms and their user bases are fundamentally different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

### User Base and Capabilities
For [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_solutions | Ethereum L2s]], users are often seeking faster and cheaper ways to perform actions already possible on the Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. In contrast, Bitcoin Layer 2s address a "zero to one" need, enabling trustless [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] activities like swapping, lending, or depositing into vaults, which are not inherently possible on the Bitcoin Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. Previously, users had to rely on centralized entities like BlockFi for such services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

The idea of a large "Bitcoin user base" is debated, with some arguing that there are primarily holders of the Bitcoin asset rather than active users of its blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:33">[01:18:33]</a>. While there are traders of ordinals on Bitcoin, their behavior often overlaps with NFT and memecoin traders on other chains like Solana, suggesting a similar speculative desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>.

### Technical Constraints
Bitcoin's technical constraints are significantly different from Ethereum's. Bitcoin has smaller and slower block sizes compared to Ethereum, relies on proof-of-work, and currently lacks native ZK verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>. These fundamental differences dictate that Bitcoin L2s must provide a distinctly different set of functionalities compared to [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Ethereum Layer 2 solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>.

## Potential for Bitcoin DeFi

The vast market capitalization of Bitcoin is often cited as an indicator of potential for [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | Bitcoin DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. However, this potential hinges on the existence of a large Bitcoin user base willing to engage in these new DeFi applications, which is not yet clearly established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. The market for Bitcoin L2s is expected to evolve differently than for Ethereum L2s due to these distinct user desires and underlying technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.

The implementation of capital controls by the United States, such as imposing taxes on foreigners, could lead to significant repercussions for the American economy and global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Concerns and Capital Exit

Some non-Americans have expressed concerns about the safety of keeping their [[global_capital_and_property_rights | property]] domiciled in the United States if such policies are enacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A primary repercussion of capital controls is the [[impact_of_foreign_capital_exit_on_us_markets | exit of capital from US shores]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This scenario can lead to a decline in the S&P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Foreigners must sell assets to reduce the capital account surplus, especially considering they have historically parked trillions of dollars of export earnings into American markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This foreign investment has been a basis for the outperformance of American property, stock, and bond markets over the past 30 years compared to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Consequently, if foreigners withdraw capital, these markets are mathematically expected to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Government Response to Capital Exit

When markets, particularly the bond market, go down and volatility increases, the typical response is to "print the money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The direct consequence of capital controls is that the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and politicians would all need to collaborate on policies to provide dollars to compensate for the departing foreign capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. These dollars would primarily be created through monetary expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Impact on Crypto and Gold

This scenario of market downturns and monetary expansion is seen as highly beneficial for [[crypto_markets_response_to_federal_economic_policies | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The anticipated consequence of these actions is that [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | gold and Bitcoin would significantly appreciate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This outcome is considered the natural "trade" in a rebalancing global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Ethereum, as a decentralized "world computer," relies on a complex ecosystem of researchers and developers to evolve and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. However, this process has historically been fraught with challenges, leading to debates, frustrations, and calls for increased efficiency and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Debates, Delays, and Frustration

For years, [[ethereum_development_priorities | Ethereum researchers and developers]] have debated which features should be shipped and when <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This has led to significant frustration, with individuals spending "tens, hundreds, thousands of hours" on features that are ultimately not included in an upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

A prominent example is the discussion around the Ethereum Object Format (EOF). Many people were confused, believing its removal from consideration was for the immediate [[ethereums_pectra_upgrade | Pectra]] release scheduled for May 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, the discussion was actually concerning *Fusaka*, an upgrade six months later, meaning it was not a "last moment removal" from the current fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This confusion highlights a core problem: the "lack of capacity to decide" on key features, leading to wasted effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.

Historically, Ethereum hard forks have occurred every 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. This "slowness" has been a point of contention, with the community frequently desiring faster progress and accelerated timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

## Communication and Transparency

A recurring criticism of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) has been its communication. In the past, the EF was perceived as "not communicating frequently about the road maps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This has led to a perceived disconnect, with the EF sometimes feeling like an "ivory tower" isolated from the daily use cases of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

There's a strong desire for:
*   **Clearer Roadmaps:** Simplified and milestone-based roadmaps, similar to those communicated by Vitalik Buterin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
*   **Proactive Engagement:** More direct communication with developers, DeFi builders, and stakers to understand their needs and concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Addressing difficult questions immediately rather than avoiding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Product-Centricity vs. Research Focus

The EF has been highly praised for its "best-in-class" research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. However, there's a recognized gap in "product mindfulness" or "product-centricity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. The community, and the new EF leadership, believe Ethereum needs to evolve into a "product that it wants to sell to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

This shift involves:
*   **User Impact:** Making changes and delivering features based on what users and application developers are asking for, ensuring relevance and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>.
*   **Early Involvement:** Bringing application developers into the early stages of EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) planning to avoid building features that don't meet their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.
*   **Quality & Support:** Focusing on the quality of the product, providing better tooling, clarity on roadmaps, and support for builders to ensure their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>.

## Balancing Centralization and Decentralization

A fundamental tension lies in the desire for strong leadership and accelerated timelines versus Ethereum's core value of decentralization and rough consensus governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. While the community wants someone to "crack the whip" and provide clear direction, this must align with the decentralized nature of the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

The [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum Foundation's role]] is seen as a "steward of the ecosystem" and a "central coordinator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. It is not the "owner of Ethereum protocol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>. The challenge is empowering others in the ecosystem to take decisions and accelerate progress, rather than dictating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.

## Addressing the Challenges: A New Direction

The new co-executive directors of the EF, Tamas Stanjac and Shiae Wong, recognize these challenges and are committed to addressing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Their approach includes:

*   **Accelerated Cadence:** Targeting a 6-month hard fork cadence, a significant increase from the historical 12-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>. This is part of [[adapting_ethereums_roadmap_for_growth | adapting Ethereum's roadmap for growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   **Clear Objectives:** Focusing on three main objectives for the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>:
    1.  **Scaling Ethereum L1:** Strengthening the mainnet for increased throughput and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:20">[02:29:20]</a>. This includes an ambitious goal of 100x scaling over four years, starting with 3x this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.
    2.  **Scaling Blobs for Layer 2s:** Supporting the Layer 2 ecosystem by providing more efficient data availability, serving as the "express lane" for L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. This is a key aspect of [[challenges_and_solutions_in_ethereum_scaling | Ethereum scaling solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
    3.  **Improving User Experience (UX):** This encompasses better interoperability standards across Layer 2s, enhanced security, reduced latency, and improved developer experience (DevX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
*   **Operational Excellence:** Emphasizing "speed of execution, accountability, clear goals, objectives, and metrics to track" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. This involves restructuring All Core Devs (ACD) calls to be more product-focused and decision-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.
*   **Increased Engagement:** Actively inviting feedback, holding more public conversations, and helping to connect builders with resources, talent, and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. The EF aims to be a "helper" and "network creator" rather than a direct implementer of all ecosystem activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.

While the community might sometimes have unfair expectations (e.g., expecting the EF not to sell ETH for operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>, or to directly handle all engineering or business development), the new leadership believes that nearly all challenges are "fixable" through a combination of internal restructuring, clear communication, and empowering the broader Ethereum ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The goal is to make Ethereum a "fast-moving juggernaut" where collective strength is amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

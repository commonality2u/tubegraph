The advent of quantum computing poses a significant, though not immediate, challenge to existing cryptographic systems, including those underpinning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. While quantum computers are not merely faster classical computers, they leverage the laws of quantum mechanics to solve specific problems with dramatic speedups, notably those related to cryptography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## Quantum Computing Developments

Recent [[quantum_computing_development_and_milestones | quantum computing development and milestones]] include Google's "Willow" chip, an engineering milestone demonstrating quantum error correction by preserving an encoded cubit for longer durations as the system scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. This breakthrough, though theorized since the 1990s, marks a critical step towards building scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. While current systems use around 103 physical cubits, breaking cryptographic codes would likely require millions of physical cubits, potentially housed in hundreds or thousands of dilution refrigerators connected by a quantum communications network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

Experts estimate that a useful, fault-tolerant quantum computer could emerge within the next decade, though the timeline for breaking cryptographic codes is less certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. The cost to build such a machine capable of breaking Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is estimated to be around $10 billion in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>. Annual global spending on quantum information research and development is already in the billions of dollars, with significant investments from private companies like Google, IBM, Amazon, and IonQ, as well as governments including the US, China, and the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. This suggests that the timeline is largely a function of funding and willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>.

## [[impact_of_quantum_computing_on_cryptography_and_cryptocurrency | Impact of Quantum Computing on Cryptography and Cryptocurrency]]

Quantum computers can dramatically speed up solutions for certain "purely classical problems" that have underlying mathematical structures, such as Abelian groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

### Cryptographic Vulnerabilities

*   **Public Key Cryptography**: Shor's algorithm, discovered in 1994, enables a quantum computer to efficiently find the prime factors of large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. This ability can break a large fraction of the encryption protecting the internet, including RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve encryption (ECDSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. Once a quantum computer can break one type of Abelian group-based cryptography, it can likely be reprogrammed to break others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Symmetric Key Cryptography and Hash Functions**: For problems like finding pre-images of hash functions (used in proof of work), Grover's algorithm offers a more modest quadratic speedup (square root of the number of steps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This means a quantum computer might solve a search problem in `sqrt(N)` steps instead of `N` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. However, the overhead of quantum error correction might negate this advantage unless `N` is extremely large (e.g., a trillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Quantum resistance for these can be achieved by simply doubling the key size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.

### [[quantum_computings_potential_to_break_Bitcoin_and_Ethereum | Quantum Computing's Potential to Break Bitcoin and Ethereum]]

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on cryptography vulnerable to quantum attacks, primarily ECDSA for digital signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. Breaking a 2048-bit key might take a quantum computer about a week initially, but this time could decrease significantly with technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.

### Bitcoin's Vulnerabilities

Bitcoin faces a "doubly screwed" situation because it uses both elliptic curves for account balances (ECDSA) and hash functions for proof of work, both susceptible to quantum attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:15">[01:42:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:30">[01:42:30]</a>.

*   **Account Vulnerability**:
    *   Many Bitcoin addresses expose their public keys on-chain, especially those holding "lost coins" like Satoshi's initial 1 million Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. If quantum computers can forge signatures from these public keys, these funds could be stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
    *   This represents a potential "societal bounty" or "Pirates Booty" of hundreds of billions, or even trillions, of dollars for the first entity to develop a sufficiently powerful quantum computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. This bounty could incentivize [[quantum_computing_development_and_milestones | quantum computing development and milestones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.
    *   While Bitcoin could implement a "soft fork" to freeze or burn these coins, this would violate its core principle of immutable property rights and require a massive social consensus that might break the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:53">[01:47:53]</a>.
*   **Proof of Work Vulnerability**:
    *   A quantum computer could use Grover's algorithm to accelerate Bitcoin mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>. If only a few entities possess such machines, they could gain a disproportionate share of the hash rate, leading to centralization and potentially a 51% attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.
    *   Such an entity could control the network, potentially setting high fees (e.g., 3% like Visa or 30% like Apple) or even attempting to "kill" Bitcoin by shorting it on derivatives markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:12">[01:57:12]</a>.
    *   While in an ideal scenario, the proof-of-work difficulty could automatically adjust if quantum mining became widespread, the transition period, where a few actors have a significant advantage, would be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

### Ethereum's Position

Ethereum is considered better positioned to handle quantum threats due to its architecture and willingness to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a>.

*   **No Proof of Work**: Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake via The Merge eliminates the quantum-vulnerable proof-of-work mining problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:48">[01:50:48]</a>.
*   **Consensus Layer**: BLS signatures used in the Beacon Chain are not post-quantum secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a>. However, [[technical_and_social_challenges_for_upgrading_cryptocurrencies_against_quantum_threats | post-quantum cryptography]] for aggregation is known, and a migration path (e.g., via the "Beam Chain" concept) is plausible within the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:24">[02:02:24]</a>. The main trade-off is larger signature sizes, increasing gas costs, but optimizations are being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.
*   **Account Layer**: ECDSA is used for accounts, but Ethereum has advantages:
    *   **Account Abstraction**: This allows accounts to define their own signature schemes, enabling a migration to post-quantum secure signatures without a hard fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:45">[02:02:45]</a>. Large holders can begin this migration today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:56">[02:02:56]</a>.
    *   **Hashed Public Keys**: From day one, many Ethereum addresses were hashes of public keys, meaning the public key is not exposed until a transaction is made, reducing the window of vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:31">[02:03:31]</a>.
    *   **Smaller "Lost Coin" Problem**: The amount of "lost" or stagnant ETH in exposed, vulnerable addresses is estimated to be around 0.1% of the total supply, a much smaller percentage than Bitcoin's, making a social intervention less likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:52">[02:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:07">[02:06:07]</a>.
*   **Data Layer (Blobs)**: The KCG cryptography used for blobs is elliptic curve-based and will need an upgrade, which can serve as an opportunity to improve the design with "blob abstraction" for better developer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:43">[02:07:43]</a>.
*   **State Trees**: While the current Patricia Merkle tree is post-quantum secure, future plans for Verkle trees might introduce non-quantum secure cryptography for efficiency. However, there's a growing interest in moving directly to a quantum-secure binary Merkle tree with SNARK-friendly hash functions to avoid multiple upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:32">[02:09:32]</a>.
*   **"Quantum Canary"**: Ethereum could implement smart contracts that automatically migrate to post-quantum cryptography if a proof of small, non-crypto-breaking quantum computers is provided on-chain, ensuring security while maintaining efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:32">[02:06:32]</a>.

## Quantum Money

The concept of quantum money, first proposed in the 1960s by Stephen Wiesner, leverages the fundamental quantum mechanical principle of the "no-cloning theorem," which states that an unknown quantum state cannot be copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:50">[02:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:15">[02:54:15]</a>. This allows for the creation of "physically unclonable cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:56">[02:55:56]</a>.

*   **Publicly Verifiable Quantum Money**: Scott Aaronson revived interest in quantum money in 2009 by proposing schemes that allow anyone to verify the authenticity of a quantum bill, not just the issuing bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:04">[02:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>. These schemes are believed to be secure based on accepted cryptographic assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:01">[02:47:01]</a>.
*   **How it Works**: Quantum money would involve private keys that are themselves quantum objects (e.g., a private superposition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:58">[02:48:58]</a>. Signing a message with the key would effectively destroy it, preventing double-spending without needing a blockchain or consensus mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:03">[02:50:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:28">[02:57:28]</a>.
*   **Technological Prerequisites**: Quantum money requires advanced quantum computers capable of preserving quantum states (coherence) for arbitrary durations (weeks, months) and a [[quantum_computing_development_and_milestones | quantum internet]] for transmitting these states between users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:54">[02:53:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:31">[02:57:31]</a>.
*   **Potential as "Gold"**: While quantum money wouldn't support smart contracts like Ethereum, it could potentially offer a more secure and efficient form of digital cash than Bitcoin, analogous to gold, without the need for constant security through fees or issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:39">[02:58:39]</a>. This would be a third generation of quantum applications, following Shor's and Grover's algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.
*   **One-Shot Signatures**: A related concept, one-shot signatures, allows a private key to sign only a single message before destroying itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>. This could enhance Ethereum's finality to "perfect finality" by making equivocation (a validator voting for two inconsistent chains) physically impossible, reducing the need for slashing and complex delegation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:55">[03:19:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:05">[03:20:05]</a>.

Overall, the impact of quantum computing on cryptography is a significant but survivable challenge, more akin to Y2K than an existential threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>. While Bitcoin faces a greater social and technical hurdle for [[technical_and_social_challenges_for_upgrading_cryptocurrencies_against_quantum_threats | upgrading cryptocurrencies against quantum threats]], Ethereum appears better positioned due to its adaptability and existing roadmap for quantum-resistant upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>. The future could even see novel forms of digital money like quantum money, further evolving the landscape of internet finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>.

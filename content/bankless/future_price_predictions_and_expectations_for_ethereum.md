Ethereum (ETH) experienced a significant 50% price increase over a seven-day period, primarily attributed to the prevailing negative market sentiment surrounding it. The phenomenon suggests that "the most hated coin or most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, a pattern considered "human nature" with "no other explanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Market Sentiment and Recent Performance

The recent surge in ETH's price is not attributed to specific events like a "Petra upgrade" or Vitalik Buterin's increased social media activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Instead, it's suggested that the asset had been "hated for the last 2 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, particularly due to the rise of Solana, which saw its price increase from $7 to $300, leading many to view it as "the new new thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The peak of this negative sentiment towards Ether was observed around March, during which the Bitcoin/ETH ratio was declining, and Solana was performing strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. At that time, much of the crypto community expressed disdain for ETH, perceiving it as "kind of dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Despite this, some individuals remained bullish on ETH during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Price Targets

While the recent price movement is positive for "ETH bulls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, it is acknowledged that there is "a long way to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> from its current price, which was around $2,700 at the time of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Comparatively, when Bitcoin was priced at $110,000, Ether was around $4,000, indicating that it has "definitely not performing as well as it could" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

For long-term holders of Ethereum, the current increase is welcomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. However, a truly "meaningful" discussion about its price would arise once it reaches significant milestones, such as $10,000 or $15,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. One ambitious prediction for the future price of Ethereum is around $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

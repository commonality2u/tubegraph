From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The concept of Real Economic Value (REV) has become a significant topic of discussion within the cryptocurrency community, particularly on Crypto Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This renewed interest was notably sparked by a tweet from John Sharbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The discussion around REV is seen by some as a sign that the market is maturing and seeking more rational valuation metrics for [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | crypto assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## What is REV?

In the context of this discussion, REV stands for **Real Economic Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. It represents the total amount of network fees and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) tips that users pay for a given network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This metric is analogous to top-line revenue for a traditional company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Distinguishing REV from other terms

It is important to differentiate this definition of REV from **Realized Extractable Value**, which was a term introduced by Flashbots a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. While both touch upon MEV, the "Real Economic Value" discussed here includes base fees (a significant component for networks like Ethereum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, whereas "Realized Extractable Value" typically does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The metric was also initially referred to as TEV (Total Economic Value) before being clarified as REV to exclude inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Interpretations and Significance of REV

REV serves two primary purposes in cryptocurrency valuation:

1.  **Value Capture Metric:** In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks, token holders are, in one form or another, entitled to receive all the REV generated by the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This can manifest as token burns or dividends paid to stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
2.  **Demand Indicator:** REV directly measures what users are willing to pay to use a given network, excluding application-level fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It's a clear signal of demand for the underlying block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

Historically, both Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) traded at nearly identical multiples to their annualized REV at their respective all-time high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This correlation suggests that market valuations might be more rational than commonly perceived, as prices surged when networks were generating peak REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, it's also argued that this is a correlation rather than causation, as high on-chain activity (leading to high REV) naturally occurs during price peaks when people are more inclined to spend money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## REV and Network Valuations

The market is increasingly demanding signs that users are willing to pay for network usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. While not the sole factor, REV is becoming one of several considerations when valuing larger tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

REV primarily reflects the utility value of a blockchain's block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. For smart contracting platforms like Ethereum and Solana, block space is valuable due to their thriving application ecosystems (e.g., MakerDAO, Uniswap on Ethereum; Pump.fun, Drift on Solana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

However, REV is not universally applicable. Bitcoin, for example, generates zero REV yet holds the highest valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This highlights that for certain [[fundamentals_and_crypto_valuation_techniques | crypto assets]], particularly those seen more as commodities or stores of value, other metrics come into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The REV Debate and Tribalism

The debate around REV is often divided along tribal lines, with Ethereum and Solana communities holding differing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

*   **Ethereum Community:** Tends to diminish the importance of REV, arguing that it doesn't fully represent Ethereum's value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. Ethereum prioritizes "holding state" and long-term verifiability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>, aligning with its role in securing vast amounts of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. They believe Ethereum possesses a "special snowflake" quality similar to Bitcoin, which is not captured by REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Solana Community:** More aligned with REV as a primary valuation metric because Solana optimizes for "state transitions" â€“ rapid and efficient trading and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

This mirrors the past debates between Bitcoin and Ethereum maxis, where different economic models and cultural priorities led to talking past each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

## Future of REV in Valuation

It is anticipated that REV will become a more significant factor in the valuation of most [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | crypto assets]] and large assets going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. However, it's unlikely to be the *sole* determinant, especially for assets like ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

### Challenges and Nuances in Applying REV

*   **Valuation Complexity:** The cryptocurrency industry is still nascent, and a universally accepted method for valuation (like discounted cash flow or multiples in traditional finance) has yet to coalesce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. REV is an earnest attempt to quantify value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Minimum Intrinsic Value:** Cash flows (and thus REV) are seen by some as representing the minimum intrinsic value of these assets. An asset generating consistent cash flow can be held for its yield, independent of speculative resale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Overvaluation:** Comparing multiples of REV to market cap for various chains (e.g., Aptos at 1,000x, Avalanche at 136x, Tron at 48x vs. ETH/SOL at ~26x at peaks) suggests that some projects might be "pricing in a lot of growth" and potentially overvalued if REV becomes the dominant metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **App-Layer Recapture:** As infrastructure improves and apps become more efficient, they may internalize more of the value (e.g., through app sequencing, better AMM designs, liquidations), potentially reducing the amount of REV captured at the base layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
*   **Volatility:** REV numbers are volatile and cannot be taken as a static spot measurement for applying clean multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.
*   **Base Fees vs. Priority Fees:** Historically, Ethereum's high REV was largely driven by base fees from network congestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. Solana's REV, in contrast, comes primarily from contentious state access (MEV and priority fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. While congestion-driven base fees are not sustainable as a primary source of REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, priority fees from high-value, fast-paced transactions can be more persistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.

Ultimately, while REV offers a valuable and objective metric of direct utility and value capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, it is seen as only one part of the equation for valuing a Layer 1 asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The market also considers narratives, growth potential, and other non-quantifiable factors, especially in a dynamic and evolving ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

While wealth is often associated with net worth, a more comprehensive understanding reveals that financial assets are only one component of a broader definition of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Narrow View: Net Worth as the Sole Metric

Historically, the concept of wealth has been predominantly tied to financial metrics, particularly net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This emphasis is often reinforced by societal perceptions that equate success with an increasing financial "score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The speaker noted that in the past, they had not taken the time to define [[defining_enough_in_terms_of_wealth | what "enough" wealth was]] for personal and family needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This perspective treated wealth accumulation like an arcade high score, rather than a means to provide for loved ones or achieve specific life goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Defining "enough" often required discussions with those in one's life, such as a spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Expanding the Definition: Beyond Financial Wealth

Recognizing the limitations of a narrow financial focus, a broader definition of wealth encompasses several [[different_types_of_wealth | distinct types of wealth]] beyond mere net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>:

*   **Financial Wealth**: This includes traditional assets like money, investments, and net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Time Wealth**: The freedom and availability of one's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Relationship/Social Wealth**: The strength and quality of one's connections with family, friends, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Mental Wealth**: Encompassing mental well-being, clarity, and peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Physical Wealth**: Referring to one's health and physical well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Upon recognizing these categories, the speaker realized they were "completely overallocated" in financial wealth while neglecting the other four types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[balancing_financial_and_nonfinancial_wealth | balancing financial and nonfinancial wealth]] for a holistic sense of prosperity. This broader perspective challenges the [[the_societal_perception_of_success_and_net_worth | societal perception of success and net worth]] that often prioritizes financial gain above all else.

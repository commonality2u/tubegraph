From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Ether (ETH) is considered the indispensable asset at the heart of the Ethereum network, essential for the success of its decentralized finance (DeFi) economy and the realization of its cyberpunk values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. A strong [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] asset is fundamental for a strong Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.

## Current Challenges and Perceptions

The Ethereum community has historically been "weak" in evangelizing and presenting the value of [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] as a programmable, censorship-resistant monetary system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>. Much focus is placed on the Ethereum network itself—bringing other assets on-chain, stablecoins, real-world assets (RWAs), and Layer 2s (L2s)—rather than the native asset, [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. There is an embedded cultural "hesitancy" or "resistance" towards the monetary value of [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]], sometimes viewing "number go up" as "dirty stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>.

However, the growth of [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]]'s value directly supports DeFi, as it is the only way to create a sovereign DeFi ecosystem that is not overrun by other tokenized assets or stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. Without a strong, multi-trillion dollar [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] asset, true sovereignty over the network cannot be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.

### Comparison to Bitcoin

Bitcoin's success in establishing itself as a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value|store of value]] was achieved through intense social layer evangelism, turning its fixed supply into "scripture" and a "religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. Bitcoiners consistently sing one "hymn": Bitcoin is a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value|store of value]], it's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. This contrasts with Ethereum, which, despite building a powerful network, risks not achieving its goal of being a censorship-resistant monetary system without a strong [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>.

While some within the Ethereum core community view [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] as merely a means to an end for producing the network, Bitcoin culture considers everything apart from its 21 million hard cap a "burden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. Emphasizing [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] as money and growing its value is seen as a 10x multiplier on all efforts to build the network, and just as noble as building a decentralized network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.

## Reorienting the Narrative and Strategy

### Ether as a Primary Use Case
[[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] itself is the number one "app" that requires nation-state level security resistance. Its trading, borrowing, and lending on Ethereum constitute a censorship-resistant global [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value|store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>.

### Promoting Ether Maximalism
To enhance [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]]'s economic standing, the community needs to:
*   Talk more about [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:54">[01:20:54]</a>.
*   Embrace a form of [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price|Ether]] maximalism: holding [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]], encouraging others to hold [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]], and celebrating those who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>.
*   Meme [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.
*   Shift the focus from [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] as a "cash flow asset" to viewing it as the internet-native currency of a massive decentralized on-chain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   Encourage L2s, DAOs, and whales to hold significant portions of their treasuries in [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]], accept transaction fees in [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]], and center [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] in wallets and dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. This creates economic alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

### Product-Centric Roadmap
[[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value|Positioning Ethereum as a store of value]] requires a strong layer 1 (L1) as the economic hub. This includes:
*   Scaling the L1 for a 100x throughput increase while preserving censorship resistance and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.
*   Encouraging developers, applications, and users to build and operate directly on the L1, shifting away from the previous "get off L1" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.
*   Integrating L2s more tightly into the L1, transforming them into "based" or "native" rollups that share Ethereum's sequencing and execution, effectively blurring the lines between L1 and L2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. This ensures that L2 activity contributes to the L1's economic network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

The previous roadmap's emphasis on L2s as the primary scaling solution led to severed feedback loops, as each L2 developed its own network effects rather than contributing back to the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. This diluted the "money-ness" of [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] because L2s could operate with various assets, not just [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] as the default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

### Reframing Ether's Valuation
[[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] should not be valued solely by discounted cash flow (DCF) models, which consider it a "cash flowing equity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. Instead, [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] should be seen as a "commodity money backed by an economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>. Buying [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] is akin to buying an index of the entire Ethereum property rights empire—its currency, "stocks," "bonds," and "land"—all priced in [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. This represents the economic activity and growth of the on-chain economy built on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.

### Embracing All Use Cases
The Ethereum community must stop "purity testing" and "gerrymandering support around products or apps or use cases which we find distasteful or immoral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. This includes being open to speculation, trading, and even memecoins, as speculators and traders are crucial for bootstrapping the application layer and bringing liquidity and volume to the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. A permissionless network should not police its use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Achieving a multi-trillion dollar [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] asset and a successful network where Ethereum's L1 is the central economic hub for property rights is the "win condition" for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. While this is harder today than in 2021-2022 due to [[comparison_between_bitcoin_and_ethereums_value_narrative|Bitcoin's continued growth as digital gold]] and [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]]'s diminished "money-ness," Ethereum still possesses the highest upside among blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>. Its "grand unified vision" of an on-chain economy offers a larger Total Addressable Market (TAM) than its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>. The market may currently be pricing [[ether_as_a_commoditylike_asset|Ether]] at a "tremendous discount," representing a significant opportunity for those who believe in its potential to become a leading [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value|store of value]] and the foundation of the internet economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

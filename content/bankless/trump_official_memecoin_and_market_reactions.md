The launch of an official [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump memecoin]] and its subsequent [[impact_of_trump_memecoin_and_political_coins | market reactions]] marked a significant event in the [[cryptocurrency_and_its_significance_according_to_trump | crypto market]], generating both astonishment and debate within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## The Launch of the Official Trump Memecoin
On January 17th, an official [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump memecoin]] was announced via the Donald J. Trump Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. The tweet encouraged supporters to "join my very special Trump Community" and acquire the "ticker sign Trump" token through getTrumpmemes.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. The website offered purchase options via debit card or crypto, specifying a Solana contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

### Initial Performance and [[value_surges_of_trump_coin | Value Surges]]
Upon its launch on Solana, the [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump token]] recorded an initial [[market_cap_discussions_related_to_trump_coin | market cap]] of approximately $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. It rapidly surged to a peak of $26 billion in [[market_cap_discussions_related_to_trump_coin | market cap]] and an $80 billion fully diluted valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, experiencing an 11,000% increase within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

This surge also had a direct [[impact_of_memecoins_on_the_crypto_market | impact on Solana]], causing its price to pump almost 50% in a week, from $175 to $286 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

## Melania Coin and Price Declines
The positive momentum for the [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump coin]] shifted dramatically with the announcement of the Melania memecoin from Melania Trump's Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. Melania launched at a $2 billion [[market_cap_discussions_related_to_trump_coin | market cap]] and $13.3 billion fully diluted valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, but quickly fell to a $600 million [[market_cap_discussions_related_to_trump_coin | market cap]] and $4 billion fully diluted valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

Following this, the [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump coin]] itself lost almost 50% of its [[market_cap_discussions_related_to_trump_coin | market cap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>, and Solana's price dropped to $230 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The launch of the Melania coin was poorly received, altering public perception of the [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump memecoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. This negative shift was exacerbated by the fact that a Trump-owned company held 80% of the memecoin's supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, and Donald Trump made no [[cryptocurrency_and_its_significance_according_to_trump | crypto-related statements]] or executive orders on his first day in office or during his inaugural speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

## Public and Industry Reactions
Reactions to the [[donald_trumps_role_in_the_crypto_market_and_the_launch_of_the_trump_meme_coin | Trump memecoin]] were mixed. Initially, there was widespread disbelief and anger within the crypto community, which eventually shifted to acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Many found the surprise unexpected, particularly as the announcement occurred during the "Crypto Ball" in Washington D.C., where many industry figures were present but unaware of the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

Despite the surprise, some noted that this aligns with Trump's past actions, including launching four separate NFT collections, a DeFi protocol on Ethereum (World Liberty Financial), and being known for selling branded memorabilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. The creation of such a token was seen as consistent with the industry's call for creator and fan tokens as a new way for individuals to monetize and interact with their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

Donald Trump himself commented on the memecoin, stating he didn't know much about it "except that I launched it" and then asked about its current valuation, remarking that "a couple billion dollars, that's nothing to these guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

However, the Melania coin diluted the overall sentiment, removing some of the "deniability" around the intent of the [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump memecoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

### Transparency and Future Implications
The official website for the [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump memecoin]] provides an allocation schedule and pie chart, detailing that 200 million Trump tokens were available on day one, growing to 1 billion over three years, with different groups having various allocations released on their own schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. While the specific identities of these groups ("creators in cic digital ones and two and three public distribution") remain somewhat opaque, the general transparency of the supply schedule was noted as a positive aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

The [[impact_of_trump_memecoin_and_political_coins | memecoin's launch]] is expected to increase the importance of consumer protection in future legislative discussions on market structure, especially for Democrats, as it highlights the need for robust disclosure requirements in digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. The prevailing sentiment is that while the crypto industry doesn't seek a "free pass" from regulation, it desires clear disclosure requirements that allow all investors to access information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

Over the years, the concept of "crypto wealth" has been discussed, but a crucial missing piece was a personal definition of "enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This isn't driven by greed, but by the enjoyment of playing the "game" of growing a business and investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that they are not interested in flashy status symbols like buying a Lambo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Instead, it was like achieving a high score in an arcade game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A significant realization was the failure to define [[personal_perspectives_on_financial_goals | "enough"]] with their spouse and those in their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Broadening the Definition of Wealth

A major misconception identified was a too narrow [[comprehensive_definitions_of_wealth | definition of wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Primarily, wealth was equated with net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

> "When I thought about wealth mostly I thought about net worth, which is definitely a key part of wealth, but that's also the part that society it imposes on us. Like we're sort of taught like what is success? It's net worth. It's kind of number go up." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>

While financial wealth is a component, it's crucial to recognize [[comprehensive_definitions_of_wealth | other forms of wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These include:
*   Time wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Relationships (social wealth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Mental wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Physical wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

Upon reflection, the speaker realized they were "completely overallocated in sort of the financial side of things" and neglecting the other four types of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

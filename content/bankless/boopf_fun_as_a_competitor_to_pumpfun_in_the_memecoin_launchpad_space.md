Boop.fun has emerged as a new [[token_launchpads_and_cryptocurrency_fundraising | memecoin launchpad]] aiming to compete with the established platform, [[pump_fun_and_its_impact_on_the_meme_coin_market | Pump.fun]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. The platform introduces intriguing tokenomics and a unique airdrop strategy designed to attract users and challenge the market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

## Airdrop Mechanics and Incentives

Boop.fun's initial strategy involved a significant airdrop for users with high Kaido scores, which are metrics related to [[meme_coins_and_their_risk_of_grift | memecoin]] activity and mind share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. To claim their airdrop, recipients were required to launch a memecoin linked to their Twitter account on the Boop.fun platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. This mechanism ensured active participation and public endorsement of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

Airdrop tiers varied, with Tier 1 recipients potentially receiving tokens valued at $200,000-$250,000, while Tier 3 recipients might receive around $80,000-$90,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. However, the full value of the airdrop vests over 30 days and requires the launched memecoin to hit specific market capitalization milestones (e.g., $5M, $10M, $15M, $20M) to unlock completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. This creates a strong incentive for users to promote their launched tokens and, by extension, the Boop.fun platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

### Boop.fun's Revenue Share Model

The platform's native token, BOOP, offers a unique value proposition for stakers. Users who stake BOOP receive a lifetime 1% pro-rata share of all trading fees (both pre-bond and post-bond) from every memecoin launched on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. Additionally, when a token "bonds" (moves from the launchpad to a public pool like Radium), 5% of its supply is distributed pro-rata to BOOP stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. This creates an "index exposure" to all tokens launched on Boop.fun for its stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

The founder of Boop.fun, known as Dingling, has a background in the NFT space and was involved with PancakeSwap and Binance, which explains his access to significant funds and understanding of token mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

## Competition with Pump.fun

[[pump_fun_and_its_impact_on_the_meme_coin_market | Pump.fun]] remains a dominant force in the memecoin launchpad space, consistently generating substantial revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>. As of current estimates, Pump.fun operates at an annualized run rate exceeding $600 million, primarily from its launchpad fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. The company retains these fees, reportedly converting a significant portion to Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.

Boop.fun's primary competitive advantage is its token-based incentive model, explicitly sharing revenue and token supply with creators and holders, a practice [[pump_fun_and_its_impact_on_the_meme_coin_market | Pump.fun]] has largely avoided (similar to how OpenSea operated before its market dominance eroded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.

### Market Dynamics and User Adoption

Despite Boop.fun's compelling tokenomics, shifting user behavior from an entrenched platform like Pump.fun is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. First-mover advantage and the established "industrial scale farming" complex built around [[pump_fun_and_its_impact_on_the_meme_coin_market | Pump.fun]] make it difficult for competitors to gain significant traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. Many memecoin traders and launchers don't directly interact with the launchpad's website; they use aggregated tools, making the specific launch platform less critical for visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.

The incentives offered by Boop.fun, such as the daily BOOP allocation (1 million BOOP per day, with 10% to launchers and 90% to holders of graduated tokens), are designed to attract creators and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. However, initial observations suggest that automatically gaming this system for profit hasn't been widely successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

Some argue that a successful disruption would require a platform that offers genuinely "better" features or a fundamentally different trading experience, rather than just lower fees or token incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>. The [[impact_of_memecoins_on_the_crypto_market | memecoin industry]] has proven to be sustainable, suggesting continuous innovation and competition in the launchpad space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

### Response from Pump.fun

[[pump_fun_and_its_impact_on_the_meme_coin_market | Pump.fun]] has shown signs of feeling the competitive pressure, hinted at by investors like Iran, who suggested that competitive pressures often lead to token launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. Pump.fun has already reduced its rake on token graduations and announced future plans to share a percentage of protocol revenue with coin creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. This indicates that competition like that posed by Boop.fun can lead to beneficial redistribution of value back to traders and creators in the [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | memecoin market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.

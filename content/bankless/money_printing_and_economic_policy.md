Concerns have been raised by non-Americans regarding the safety of keeping property domiciled in the United States, especially in light of potential capital controls or taxes on foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Such policies could lead to capital exiting US shores and a decline in the S&P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This scenario is paradoxically seen as highly beneficial for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Economic Repercussions of Capital Flight

To reduce the capital account surplus, foreigners would need to sell their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The historical outperformance of American property, stock, and bond [[impact_of_federal_reserve_policies_on_markets | markets]] over the past 30 years, compared to the rest of the world, has been based on foreigners parking trillions of dollars of export earnings in these [[impact_of_federal_reserve_policies_on_markets | markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. If these foreign investors leave, American [[impact_of_federal_reserve_policies_on_markets | markets]] are mathematically certain to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Even a marginal exodus of investors could trigger significant market drops, akin to events seen between April 2nd and April 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Role of Money Printing

A consistent observation is that whenever [[impact_of_federal_reserve_policies_on_markets | markets]] decline, particularly the [[impact_of_federal_reserve_policies_on_markets | bond market]], and volatility increases, the response is to [[potential_recession_and_money_printing | print more money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

> "The consequence of capital controls is that the Treasury, the Fed, and politicians must all do their part to create policies to provide dollars to replace the foreigners who are leaving, and they're just going to print them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

In such a scenario, where capital controls lead to foreign capital flight, the [[us_governments_fiscal_and_monetary_policy_challenges | US government's fiscal and monetary policy challenges]] would necessitate action from the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and politicians to replace the departing foreign dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The method to achieve this would be through the [[potential_recession_and_money_printing | printing]] of new dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Investment Implications

The consequence of this widespread money [[potential_recession_and_money_printing | printing]] is predicted to cause the value of gold and Bitcoin to significantly increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This represents a key investment strategy amidst a rebalancing of the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

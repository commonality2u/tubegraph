From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Bankless hosts Zerox Bred and John Charbano, both informal crypto researchers and educators, discussed the evolving [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | Ethereum roadmap]] and its current position, particularly in light of recent conversations around [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ethereum's future strategic direction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. An episode featuring Ansgar and Dank significantly altered the discussion, prompting a vision for [[Ethereums strategic pivot and scaling layer 1 efforts | Ethereum's Layer 1]] (L1) with renewed focus from [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This vision maintains a rollup-centric roadmap but emphasizes a strong L1 foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Initial Reactions to the Pivot

John Charbano found the shift "great," sharing sentiments with Ansgar and Dank regarding the need for concrete actions beyond just discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. While the major concrete steps are yet to be shipped, the "vibe change" over the last 3-6 months has been positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This shift includes an acceptance of existing problems, a desire to fix them, and a move towards a product-first mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

> [!note] Leadership Shakeup
> A [[Changes in the Ethereum Foundation and community dynamics | leadership shakeup]] within the Ethereum Foundation (EF), notably with Damossh, is seen as a positive step to restart things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. John noted that conversations with EF members, like Donrad, reveal a distinct difference in how things are now working compared to a few months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Brad agreed, noting his long-standing call for L1 scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. He believes that prioritizing Ethereum's own block space and state is crucial for driving value back to the Ethereum asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Community Comprehension and Sphere of Concern

The general consensus within the [[Ethereum community culture | Ethereum community]] over the past 6-9 months points to the prioritization of L1 as the "missing piece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Previously, Ethereum's "sphere of concern" was perceived as too large, encompassing all Layer 2s (L2s) that touch Ethereum, potentially at the cost of L1 focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This perspective has shifted, with many now believing L1 should be the epicenter of the community's concern for a sustainable ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

The hosts discussed various community reactions to visual representations of this shift:
*   An image depicting a growing Ethereum L1 circle surrounded by L2s received overwhelmingly positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This suggested that ETH holders desire a larger, more powerful L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   A subsequent image, illustrating concentric circles of "Ethereum-ness" (L1 at the core, then base and native rollups, then other rollups, then generic L2s), received mixed reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Some L2 leaders felt "hurt" by the implication that they were "less Ethereum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

John Charbano pointed out the irony that those who liked the first image (larger L1) but disliked the second (degree of "Ethereum-ness") were implicitly contradicting themselves, as if all L2s are "Ethereum," the size of the L1 shouldn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. He noted that L2s have benefited from being associated with Ethereum's branding, making them resistant to a "deprioritization" of that association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

## L1 Scaling and L2 Dynamics

The discussion explored the impact of L1 scaling on L2s, questioning whether it would be a zero-sum or positive-sum game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
*   **Positive-sum argument:** If L1 scaling boosts ETH price to, for example, $5k, L2s would also benefit from increased assets and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   **Zero-sum argument:** A stronger L1 might "take users away" from L2s, especially those that haven't sufficiently differentiated themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

The general sentiment is that setting a higher bar for L2s is positive, as it encourages them to offer unique differentiation beyond just being "faster and cheaper than L1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

> [!quote] John Charbano on L2 Differentiation
> "If like all you need is like a pretty vanilla you know decent EVM blockchain to just like do some normal stuff like you should probably just have a layer one that can do that. Um, so you don't have a million people trying to go launch that elsewhere." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>

The conversation touched upon the potential for some L2s to "shut down" as L1 refocuses, especially those without strong differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. This represents a "natural selection" accelerated by the L1 reprioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

## The "Parasitic" L2 Debate

The term "parasitic" in relation to L2s, often attributed to Kyle Samani, was discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. Brad argues that an L2 isn't inherently parasitic; it becomes so when the L1 team diverts resources to specifically help L2s and push users to them, rather than prioritizing their own ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. John adds that the relationship between L1s and L2s is a "fuzzy spectrum" ranging from parasitic to symbiotic and altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.

The core idea is that if the [[Ethereums strategic pivot and scaling layer 1 efforts | Ethereum L1]] was sufficiently strong, L2s wouldn't capture as much value from it, leading to a more sustainable equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. This was likened to the Federal Reserve's interest rates: if L1 capacity is too low (like low interest rates), too many L2s will "crop up" unnecessarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.

## ETH, Price, and Messaging

The discussion concluded with thoughts on ETH's price performance relative to Bitcoin and the messaging around ETH as an asset. The decline in ETH/BTC price after December 2021 was attributed to:
1.  A diminishing belief in ETH credibly competing with Bitcoin as a non-sovereign store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.
2.  Within the "smart contract bucket," Ethereum's probability of winning has consistently decreased as competitors like Solana mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>.

The hosts debated whether the [[Ethereum community culture | Ethereum community]] should stop talking about ETH price and instead focus on growing L1 fundamentals, users, and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. Brad suggests "the unstoppable computer" as a concise one-liner for Ethereum, emphasizing its properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. John largely agreed that a "de-prioritization of speaking about the asset would be pretty beneficial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>, believing the market will reward growth and utility regardless.

Building an effective organizational structure, particularly one that fosters high performance, is a long-term endeavor that cannot be rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This process involves more than just individual talent; it requires the strategic [[assembly_of_talented_teams | assembly of talented teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Role of Assembling Talented Teams
A key aspect of effectiveness, as exemplified by figures like Elon Musk, is the ability to surround oneself with an exceptional collective of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This collective can consist of approximately 20 highly talented individuals who are among the most capable humans globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Finding such individuals is rare, often occurring only a couple of times per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## [[the_importance_of_longterm_development | Long-Term Development]] and Trust
Identifying the true potential and reliability of these key team members requires significant [[the_importance_of_longterm_development | long-term development]] and testing, sometimes taking a decade or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Each of the companies founded by Musk typically features about five exceptionally talented people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Notable examples of such integral team members include:
*   Mark Josa at SpaceX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Steve Davis at The Boring Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

## Achieving Seamless Collaboration
These highly skilled individuals develop a profound "mind meld," enabling them to work together seamlessly without needing explicit communication to understand what needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This level of synchronization contributes significantly to organizational effectiveness.

## The Time Investment
Creating such a self-sustaining and maximally evolved "organism" or organizational structure is a lengthy process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It can take approximately 20 years to build this kind of highly effective, integrated team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

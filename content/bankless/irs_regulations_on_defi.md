From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has finalized a tax rule that could significantly impact the [[regulatory_landscape_for_defi | DeFi]] sector, potentially requiring all [[regulatory_landscape_for_defi | DeFi]] brokers to collect user trading information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. This rule, set to begin in 2027, is seen as a de facto Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for all [[regulatory_landscape_for_defi | DeFi]] front ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>.

## Origin of the Rule

The IRS's interpretation stems from the 2021 Biden infrastructure bill, which included language expanding broker reporting requirements to hit crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. While it was clear that exchanges with crypto asset custody would be defined as brokers and required to issue 1099 forms, the application to [[regulatory_landscape_for_defi | DeFi]] was ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. The IRS has now clarified its interpretation, asserting that this rule applies to [[regulatory_landscape_for_defi | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.

The IRS's objective is to increase tax compliance by having more forms filled out, and they prefer large, centralized institutions to complete these forms on behalf of their users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

## Defining "DeFi Broker"

The definition of a "[[regulatory_landscape_for_defi | DeFi]] broker" under this rule is still somewhat unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. According to Gabe Shapiro, it appears to cover nearly all [[regulatory_landscape_for_defi | DeFi]] web application providers and some wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. Examples likely to be covered include Uniswap and MetaMask's swap features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. If a platform takes a fee on a trade, it is more likely to be considered a broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.

## Implications for DeFi Frontends and Users

For [[regulatory_landscape_for_defi | DeFi]] front ends, compliance would mean requiring users to provide personal information such as their name, address, and Social Security number before making a trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. This effectively mandates AML/KYC for every action taken in [[regulatory_landscape_for_defi | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

DeFi frontends face several options:
*   **Comply:** Accept their designation as a broker and integrate full KYC/AML procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.
*   **Block US users:** Since the rule only applies to U.S. taxpayers, platforms could restrict access for users in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.
*   **Full Decentralization:** Abandon front-end upgradeability and move towards a fully decentralized model where users run the interface locally, potentially avoiding the "broker" definition if no fees are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

The rule is set to take effect after January 1st, 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>.

## Industry Response and Outlook

The crypto industry is actively fighting back against these regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. The DeFi Education Fund, the Blockchain Association, and other industry participants have expressed strong opposition, with a lawsuit already filed against the IRS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. The lawsuit argues that the IRS lacks the authority under the Administrative Procedures Act to interpret and implement such a broad rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.

There is also speculation that a new U.S. presidential administration, specifically a potential Trump administration, could reverse these regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. Historically, [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | crypto regulation]] often begins with the most restrictive interpretations, which are then incrementally walked back by the industry's efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

While the week saw limited direct action for [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Bitcoin and Ether ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, significant developments occurred in the broader crypto ETF landscape and related [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | regulatory developments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## New ETF Filings

Bitwise has filed for a Dogecoin ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This is considered a logical third contender for an ETF due to Dogecoin's established "Lindy" effect (longevity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. However, there's a perception that the SEC may delay approval for Dogecoin to avoid creating a precedent for listing all other meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

In addition to the Dogecoin filing, Tuttle Capital has filed for ten different leveraged crypto asset ETFs, including 2x long XRP, [[solana_futures_and_etf_developments | Solana]], Trumpcoin, Melania coin, Cardano, Chainlink, Polkadot, and Bonk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

## Regulatory Environment and ETF Potential

There appears to be more regulatory appetite for a [[solana_futures_and_etf_developments | Solana]] ETF compared to a Dogecoin ETF, due to the perceived importance of giving retail investors access to [[solana_futures_and_etf_developments | Solana]] via a ready vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

Before direct ETFs, some speculate that "MicroStrategy for Doge" or "MicroStrategy for [[solana_futures_and_etf_developments | Solana]]" entities might emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. An example of this is Soul CF in Canada, which is a company holding [[solana_futures_and_etf_developments | Solana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. While Soul CF trades at a significant premium to its Net Asset Value (NAV), its relatively small market cap limits its ability to impact the [[solana_futures_and_etf_developments | Solana]] market significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. The US market, being much larger, could drive substantial interest if such a vehicle allowed 401k access to Doge or [[solana_futures_and_etf_developments | Solana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

## Impact of SEC Rule Changes

The recent repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 by the SEC is a significant development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This rule previously forced banks to treat Bitcoin and other crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, requiring an additional $100,000 in liability for every $100,000 of Bitcoin custodied, making it "terribly capital inefficient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. The repeal means banks now have the "green light" to custody crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

This change is seen as a "breath of fresh air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a> and a reversal of a "Gensler overreach," as no other asset requires offsetting equity for custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. While unlikely to immediately enable retail customers to see Bitcoin balances in their Wells Fargo accounts, it is expected to primarily benefit institutional custody, as seen with State Street which previously faced challenges due to SAB 121 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. This [[regulatory_shifts_with_the_sec_cftc_and_implications_for_the_crypto_industry | regulatory shift]] is seen as a step towards a "sane Administration" regarding SEC oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

## Broader Political and Economic Context

The discussion of central banks potentially adding Bitcoin to reserves also highlights the increasing mainstream consideration of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. The Czech Central Bank is voting on allocating up to 5% of its reserves to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. Meanwhile, Norway's Central Bank has revealed ownership of $500 million in MicroStrategy stock, not direct Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Calls for the US to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve echo these international developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. However, it's considered highly unlikely for the US government to proactively buy Bitcoin for its balance sheet due to the current political climate and congressional control over spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. The focus for the US is more on retaining seized Bitcoin rather than actively acquiring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.

The overall sentiment is that the market needs calm, and while crypto's long-term outlook is bullish due to [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | regulatory developments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a> and demand, patience is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

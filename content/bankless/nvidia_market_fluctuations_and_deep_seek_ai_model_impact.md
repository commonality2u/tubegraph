The past week saw significant market fluctuations for Nvidia, largely attributed to the emergence of the [[chinas_deepseek_ai_model | Chinese DeepSeek AI model]]. This event contributed to a chaotic week in the broader market, demonstrating how external factors, particularly in the realm of [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_global_markets | AI advancements]], are increasingly influencing the crypto world [01:05:05].

## NVIDIA's Market Shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>

Nvidia experienced a substantial downturn, shedding almost $600 billion in market capitalization, marking the largest single-day loss in US history, a 17% drop [00:02:16]. This decline occurred amid news of the [[DeepSeek AI model and its impact on Nvidia | DeepSeek AI model]] from a Chinese AI lab [00:02:24].

### The DeepSeek AI Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>

The [[chinas_deepseek_ai_model | DeepSeek AI model]] unveiled a new open-source model that claimed to have been built in two months for under $6 million [00:02:29]. While the validity of this specific cost claim is debated, the model's performance as a ChatGPT competitor is considered "extremely strong and extremely real" [00:02:40]. DeepSeek quickly rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts, reaching number one at the time of recording [00:02:47]. David Sacks, an [[AI and cryptocurrency market trends | AI and crypto analyst]], stated that the [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_global_markets | AI race]] would be very competitive, urging against complacency [00:02:55].

The initial Wall Street reaction to DeepSeek was delayed, as the paper detailing the model had been released a week prior to the market's response [00:03:12]. Misinformation around the model's cost persisted; the $6 million figure referred to the training cost of the *final iteration* of the model (V3, released in December), not the overall capital expenditure (capex) of building an AI lab [00:03:30]. The actual cost, including GPU acquisition, salaries, and failed training runs, likely exceeded $100 million, though this is significantly less than what [[OpenAI updates and their effects | OpenAI]] or Meta spend [00:04:00].

### Implications for AI Development and NVIDIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>

This development suggests that [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_global_markets | AI development]] is becoming much cheaper than previously thought, which is beneficial for consumers and most [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_global_markets | AI products]] [00:04:29]. However, it is detrimental for producers like Nvidia, whose market value is tied to high costs of [[role_of_gpus_in_deep_learning | GPUs in deep learning]] and proprietary models [00:04:47]. The situation was compared to a drop in oil prices: good for consumers, bad for producers like Exxon [00:04:51].

The [[chinas_deepseek_ai_model | DeepSeek model]] is notable for being truly open source, releasing all intermediate models, not just the final one, unlike Meta's Llama [00:05:20]. This open-source approach, fueled by the competitive [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_global_markets | AI arms race]] between China and the US, could lead to advanced models becoming freely available to the public within months [00:06:37].

A leaked Google internal document had previously suggested there is "no moat in AI" due to the rapid progress of open-source projects [00:07:07]. [[chinas_deepseek_ai_model | DeepSeek R1]], for example, is reported to perform as well as [[OpenAI updates and their effects | OpenAI]]'s O1 model at one-twentieth the cost [00:07:25]. This challenges the perceived "moat" of leading [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_global_markets | AI companies]] and signals [[Nvidias market vulnerability to competition | Nvidia's market vulnerability to competition]] [00:07:47].

The market reaction to [[Nvidias market vulnerability to competition | Nvidia's stock drop]] was partly influenced by an article by Jeffrey Emanuel, which served as a short case for Nvidia [00:08:35]. The article, published on a Friday, saw its readership balloon from dozens to 2.5 million views over the weekend, particularly among financial and tech hubs, preceding Nvidia's Monday stock plunge [00:08:52].

Nvidia's stock initially dropped 17% but then rebounded 9% the following day, illustrating a market overreaction [00:10:10]. While [[Nvidias market vulnerability to competition | Nvidia's stock]] decline was considered appropriate given the implications for its business model (preferring closed, high-markup models), the broader market's bearish sentiment on other [[crypto_market_trends_and_ai_coin_volatility | risk assets]] was deemed a mistake [00:10:07]. Cheaper [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_global_markets | AI]] is seen as beneficial for all [[crypto_market_trends_and_ai_coin_volatility | risk assets]] and the broader economy, as it implies lower costs for integrating AI [00:10:49]. This environment is considered very positive for decentralized [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_global_markets | AI]] and open-source initiatives [00:07:56].

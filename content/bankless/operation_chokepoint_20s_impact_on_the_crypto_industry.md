Recent revelations, including unredacted documents and emails, have confirmed the existence and nature of [[regulatory_changes_and_their_implications_for_the_crypto_industry | Operation Chokepoint 2.0]], validating concerns within the crypto community that federal agencies were actively discouraging banks from engaging with crypto businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

## Unveiling Chokepoint 2.0

Operation Chokepoint 2.0 refers to an alleged coordinated effort by U.S. regulatory agencies to limit the ability of crypto companies to access traditional banking services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. This effort was primarily driven by the stance that banks should not hold crypto or allow their activities to intersect with the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

### Key Figures and Accusations
*   **Michael Barr:** The former Vice Chair of the Fed, who resigned effective February 28th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>, was a prominent figure against banks holding crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. Senator Cynthia Lummis criticized Barr for "completely failed to fulfill his duties" and "enabling Operation Chokepoint 2.0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. Caitlyn Long also had issues with Barr and the operation, as her Bitcoin bank in Wyoming was denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. Barr was also implicated in pressuring Silvergate to "voluntarily liquidate" in March 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.
*   **Remaining "Villains":** According to Nick Carter's "Wanted list," Senator Elizabeth Warren, Michael Gibson, and Nelly Lang are among the few remaining original figures associated with Operation Chokepoint 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.

### Email Evidence
Paul Grey, Chief Legal Counsel for Coinbase, obtained unredacted emails through FOIA requests and court orders, revealing direct communication from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. These emails provided the "missing link" and proof of a coordinated effort by the FDIC to restrict crypto-related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

Examples of FDIC directives to banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>:
*   "We respectfully ask you that you pause all crypto related activity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>
*   Regarding a bank offering Bitcoin transactions to 2,800 customers: "The FDIC has a number of questions until that review is completed... the bank should not expand this service to any additional customers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>
*   "We respectfully ask that you not implement this product while we consider this crypto asset related activity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>
*   "Accordingly, until we complete our review, We request that the bank refrain from providing this service to its customers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>
*   "The bank should not proceed with any crypto asset activity until such time that the FC I has determined the bank's ability to implement the activity in a safe and sound manner." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>

## Political Shift and Outlook

The release of these emails and Michael Barr's resignation signal a potential shift in the political landscape regarding crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>. David Sachs, appointed as an advisor on crypto and AI by the Trump administration, has stated that "Operation Chokepoint 2.0 needs to be looked at" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.

Internationally, there are also signs of shifting political winds. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has resigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>. Pierre Poilievre, who once promised to make Canada a "crypto Capital" and bought a chicken sandwich with Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>, is slated to be the next prime minister of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. These developments suggest a potential [[regulatory_developments_in_the_united_states_impacting_the_crypto_industry | political vibe shift]] that could favor the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.

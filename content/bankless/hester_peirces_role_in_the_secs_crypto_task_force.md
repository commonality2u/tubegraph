Hester Peirce, widely known as "Crypto Mom" since 2018 for her public dissent against the SEC's rejection of a Bitcoin ETF [04:18:20], has taken on a pivotal role within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With a new administration and SEC chair at the helm [01:00:15], Commissioner Peirce was appointed head of the [[US Crypto Task Force and regulatory developments | SEC's Crypto Task Force]] [04:41:40]. This marks a significant shift in the agency's approach, moving towards a more collaborative rather than antagonistic stance with the crypto industry [00:52:19].

## The SEC's Crypto Task Force

The [[US Crypto Task Force and regulatory developments | Crypto Task Force]] was established on January 21st, on day one of the new administration [06:09:16]. It is primarily composed of experienced SEC staff who have long considered these issues, augmented by a few external hires, such as Landon Zinda from Coin Center [06:32:41]. The task force aims to foster positive changes within the [[regulatory_shifts_with_the_sec_cftc_and_implications_for_the_crypto_industry | regulatory framework]] [05:59:45].

The task force's goals include:
*   **Encouraging Disclosure**: Flipping the prior approach of discouraging disclosure to actively encouraging it [11:47:48].
*   **Providing Relief**: Recommending commission action for temporary prospective and retroactive relief for token offerings [10:47:50].
*   **Clarifying Jurisdiction**: Identifying areas that fall outside the SEC's jurisdiction and welcoming requests for no-action letters [16:03:06].
*   **Collaboration**: Working with the industry and other agencies to develop practical and workable solutions [22:44:03].

The SEC is welcoming input from the public, encouraging submissions of written information or meetings, for which individuals should provide a plan for discussion. The email address for contact is `crypto@sec.gov` [14:29:08].

## Key Initiatives and Objectives

### Rescission of SAB 121

One of the immediate actions taken by the [[US Crypto Task Force and regulatory developments | Crypto Task Force]] was the repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) [06:15:33]. SAB 121 had limited the scope of entities willing to undertake crypto custody due to severe consequences, preventing traditional custodians from operating in the space [08:42:04]. Its rescission is expected to open the door for more participants and increase transparency, returning the regulatory environment to its state before the bulletin was issued [09:13:30].

### Retroactive Relief and Safe Harbors

Commissioner Peirce is exploring the possibility of providing temporary prospective and retroactive relief for coin or token offerings [10:47:50]. This relief would be contingent on the issuing entity, or another responsible entity, providing specified, updated information and agreeing not to contest the commission's jurisdiction in cases of fraud allegations [10:51:30]. The aim is to give comfort to projects about making disclosures, providing a "runway" to achieve more dispersed control and removing the "shadow" of regulatory uncertainty [12:35:05]. This concept builds on her previously proposed "safe harbor" drafts, available on GitHub, which aimed to facilitate discussion [14:57:39].

### No-Action Letters

The task force is welcoming requests for no-action letters, which are staff-level assurances that the SEC will not recommend an enforcement action if a project operates under described circumstances [16:08:44]. While typically staff-level and not binding on the commission, they offer insight into staff thinking [17:24:06]. Commissioner Peirce cited the Fly Fish Club NFT case as an example where no-action relief might have been sought in the current climate [18:41:40]. The task force is deliberating where no-action relief makes sense versus more formal rule-making processes [18:00:39].

### Addressing Industry Concerns and Enforcement Actions

The SEC acknowledges the industry's nervousness about engaging with the agency due to past experiences [20:16:03]. Commissioner Peirce emphasized the need to change the culture and build a healthy relationship, which will require successful outcomes [20:30:22]. The goal is to create a system that works for builders, including smaller projects, not just large financial companies with extensive legal teams [21:11:46].

Regarding the existing "hairball" of [[SEC lawsuits and crypto regulation | enforcement actions]] against crypto entities [23:13:00], the task force is actively thinking about how to approach them [24:11:00]. Commissioner Peirce noted that making policy through enforcement actions can complicate new policy objectives [24:35:10].

### Inter-Agency Collaboration

Commissioner Peirce expressed optimism for improved collaboration between the SEC and the CFTC, particularly concerning the line between securities and commodities [25:35:36]. She highlighted her past work with former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz on swaps and the positive relationship with current acting CFTC Chairman Fam [25:52:19]. The aim is to establish a clear jurisdictional framework, potentially through a joint advisory committee or informal staff cooperation, ensuring jurisdiction lies where it makes the most sense, ultimately guided by Congress [26:27:10].

### Crypto Tokens as Securities

While acknowledging that some tokens, particularly those representing traditional equity or debt, will likely be deemed [[SEC lawsuits and crypto regulation | securities]] [31:21:04], Commissioner Peirce believes many open networks designed for wide participation may not fit neatly into existing securities laws [31:54:02]. She emphasized concerns about requiring an intermediary for every peer-to-peer token transfer, as this goes against the decentralized nature of many projects [32:21:00]. She also raised questions about the extent of financial privacy in the U.S. and whether existing KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements and government monitoring are balanced appropriately against individual freedom [36:30:00].

### Investor Accreditation and Market Access

The task force recognizes the limitations of investor accreditation laws, which restrict unaccredited retail investors from accessing many investment opportunities, especially in private markets [38:56:00]. While some mechanisms like Reg A and Reg CF exist to democratize investing, they are not widely used in crypto [38:00:44]. The SEC under new leadership is likely to focus on capital formation and exploring ways to allow broader access to private markets for non-accredited investors [39:29:08]. Alternatives to wealth/income thresholds, such as educational requirements or subject-matter expertise, are being considered [40:48:00].

### [[Regulation of meme coins and their fit within the SECs jurisdiction | Meme Coins]] and Airdrops

Regarding [[regulation of meme coins and their fit within the SECs jurisdiction | meme coins]] and airdrops, Commissioner Peirce stressed that "facts and circumstances matter" [44:40:40]. While people can have fun with [[regulation of meme coins and their fit within the SECs jurisdiction | meme coins]], she cautioned against assuming an SEC regulatory backstop or government bailouts for losses [45:01:23]. She reiterated that general anti-fraud laws still apply across the U.S., and if the SEC lacks jurisdiction but identifies potential fraud, it will refer the matter to the appropriate entity [48:06:58]. For airdrops, a blanket statement cannot be made as implications depend on the specific asset being airdropped [47:09:44]. The SEC welcomes specific generic scenarios for guidance on airdrops via `crypto@sec.gov` [47:31:00].

## Future Outlook

The [[US Crypto Task Force and regulatory developments | Crypto Task Force]] has a substantial workload, including issues around broker-dealer custody, investment advisor custody, and [[stablecoin regulatory issues and US Treasury role | DeFi]] [49:14:09]. They are also handling numerous applications for exchange-traded products [49:57:04]. Commissioner Peirce urged the public to share their priorities to help allocate limited staff time [49:42:04]. The primary focus remains on clarifying whether a project is covered by the SEC's jurisdiction or not, as resolving this fundamental question can simplify other issues [51:21:00].

Commissioner Peirce expressed renewed excitement for her role due to the opportunity to implement positive and productive changes, collaborating with Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda and incoming Chairman Paul Atkins [52:34:57]. Her goal is to build a regulatory system where innovators can focus on building new things, rather than navigating complex legal systems, while still ensuring accountability for fraud and promoting responsible investment [53:57:00].

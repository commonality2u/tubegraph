The global economy is currently in the midst of a significant shift towards a [[implications_of_a_new_monetary_order | new monetary structure]], moving away from the post-World War II systems of Bretton Woods, the petrodollar, and petro-yuan. This transition is expected to bring about fundamental changes in global liquidity and has profound implications for financial markets, particularly for gold and Bitcoin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>

## Historical Monetary Structures

Understanding the current shifts requires a look back at the monetary systems that have shaped the global economy since World War II:

### Bretton Woods (1944-1971)
After World War II, the United States, along with its allies, established the Bretton Woods system to economically divide the world and rebuild economies, partly to contain Soviet Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> Under this agreement, participant countries pegged their currencies to the U.S. dollar, which in turn was pegged to gold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a> The U.S. government guaranteed that central banks could exchange dollars for gold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> This system allowed the U.S. to finance the rebuilding of Europe and Japan, enabling them to export their way to prosperity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>
The system began to unravel in the 1970s as the U.S. ran large deficits due to programs like the Great Society and the Vietnam War. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> Foreign countries, notably France, started demanding their gold back in exchange for dollars. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> In 1971, President Nixon ended the dollar's convertibility to gold, marking the end of Bretton Woods and the beginning of the petrodollar era. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>

### The Petrodollar (1971-1994)
Following the Nixon shock, the U.S. established a strong link between the dollar and oil. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> A deal was made with Saudi Arabia: if they sold their oil in dollars, the U.S. would provide weapons and ensure their regional dominance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> The Saudis, in turn, would invest their dollar earnings in U.S. banks and treasuries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> Since oil was essential for the global economy, this arrangement compelled other nations to acquire dollars to purchase petroleum, effectively backing the dollar with oil and the U.S. military's might. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>

### The Petro-yuan (1994-Present)
While many believed the petrodollar era continued, a new phase emerged around 1994, termed "petro-yuan" due to China's increasing economic influence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> Historically, China and India were the world's largest economies for thousands of years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> China, aiming to become a manufacturing powerhouse, devalued its yuan in 1994 to boost exports. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> This, coupled with decreased global reliance on OPEC oil due to new discoveries, led to a mercantilist policy among Asian exporting countries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>
These nations would undervalue their currencies and accumulate U.S. treasuries to ensure access to dollar-denominated imports like oil and food. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a> This system allowed American and European economies to de-industrialize, financialize, keep inflation low, and increase corporate profits. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a> However, it led to a significant disparity in the U.S., where the top 10% holding stocks benefited, while the bottom 90%, without university degrees, saw high-paying jobs disappear and entered the gig economy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a> This social imbalance has made the petro-yuan system unsustainable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>

## The Coming Monetary Shift and [[capital_controls_and_the_consequences_for_global_markets | Capital Controls]]

The current U.S. administration, led by figures like Trump and his advisors (e.g., JD Vance, Scott Bessant), believes the post-1971 system, where U.S. Treasury bonds served as the global reserve asset, has led to these social problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a> They aim to rectify trade imbalances and bring back American jobs, a policy often referred to as "national capitalism." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>

### Tariffs as a Tool
Initially, tariffs were implemented to address trade deficits. For example, in April, a 10% tariff on all imports was introduced, with higher rates for China (34%) and the EU (20%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a> However, tariffs proved to be politically destabilizing, causing goods inflation and making it difficult for the median voter to afford imported goods without an increase in wages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a> This led to a 90-day truce with China, signaling that tariffs are not a sustainable political tool for achieving the desired rebalancing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>

### Shift to Capital Controls
The likely next step to address imbalances will be [[capital_controls_and_the_consequences_for_global_markets | capital controls]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a> This approach directly targets the capital account surplus and foreign ownership of U.S. financial assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a> Economists like Michael Pettis and others with influence on policymakers advocate for these controls. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>

Possible forms of capital controls include:
*   **"User fees" or taxes** on foreign ownership of U.S. stocks, bonds, and real estate. A 2% annual tax on the roughly $33 trillion of foreign assets in the U.S. could generate $660 billion, enough to eliminate personal income taxes for 90% of Americans, making it a politically popular move. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>
*   **Forcing allies to buy long-term, devalued bonds**, like a "century bond" with a 90% devaluation, in exchange for dollar access. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>
*   **Outright bans** on certain countries or nationals from owning specific assets, as seen with Texas banning citizens from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from buying land. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>

> [!NOTE] Distinction between Reserve Currency and Reserve Asset
> The dollar remains the global reserve currency for billing goods. However, the U.S. administration aims to shift away from the U.S. Treasury bond as the global reserve asset, favoring alternatives like gold (and potentially Bitcoin). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>

### Consequences of Capital Controls: Capital Flight and Money Printing
Implementing [[capital_controls_and_the_consequences_for_global_markets | capital controls]] will likely lead to U.S. capital flight, where foreigners sell U.S. assets and repatriate capital. This will cause U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar to decline, and yields to rise. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>

> [!TIP] The Inevitable Money Printing
> When markets go down, especially the bond market, and volatility rises, the response is typically money printing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> The Treasury, Fed, and politicians will create policies to provide dollars to replace those leaving, leading to more printing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a> This is considered the "best thing that could ever happen for crypto." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>

This capital flight is already subtly occurring. In early May, currencies like the Taiwan dollar and South Korean won appreciated significantly, indicating that authorities are not intervening to maintain the previous system, suggesting an acceptance of change. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>

## Global Liquidity Trends and Implications for Assets

The core thesis for understanding market movements, especially for crypto assets, revolves around [[global_liquidity_trends_and_m2_cycle | global liquidity]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a> Bitcoin's value is seen as a combination of technology and liquidity: its underlying technology works, so its price depends on how many units of fiat currency are chasing new stores of value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>

### Key Indicators for Global Liquidity
*   **United States:** Excess reserves at the Fed plus other deposits and liabilities from the banking system are proxies for bank lending and deposits created by quantitative easing (QE). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a> Policies like Treasury buybacks, where new bonds are issued to buy old ones, are also liquidity positive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>
*   **China:** The fiscal impulse and the People's Bank of China (PBC) policies are key. China has embarked on the largest debt expansion in human history but is now hesitant to expand liquidity further due to concerns about capital misallocation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>
*   **Japan:** Bank of Japan easing policies and bond purchases influence the Yen carry trade. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:44">[01:15:44]</a>
*   **European Union:** European Central Bank (ECB) policies, member country bond purchases, and banking system lending are relevant. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>

### The Role of the Fed and Treasury
The Federal Reserve, along with the Treasury Department, plays a crucial role in managing liquidity. While they might publicly speak about fighting inflation or maintaining tight monetary policy, their ultimate goal is to fund the U.S. government and preserve the empire. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>

*   **Covert QE:** Despite claiming quantitative tightening (QT), the Fed has been covertly buying 10-year bonds to keep yields down. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>
*   **Future QE:** Powerful bankers, like Jamie Dimon, publicly indicate that quantitative easing is expected to restart in 2026. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a> What Jamie Dimon wants, Jamie Dimon gets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>
*   **Political Expediency:** Politicians avoid direct monetary policies like QE if the public equates them with inflation, opting for alternative methods or nomenclature to achieve the same result. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>

> [!IMPORTANT] The MOVE Index
> The MOVE Index, a bond volatility index, is a critical indicator. When it rises above 135-140, an immediate policy response from U.S. authorities is expected, usually involving liquidity injection to stabilize the bond market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>

### Investment Implications
The impending [[capital_controls_and_the_consequences_for_global_markets | capital controls]] and subsequent money printing are predicted to have specific impacts on various asset classes:
*   **Bonds:** U.S. Treasury bonds, especially the long end, are considered a poor investment. No reason to own bonds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a> Institutions are often "regulated bag holders" forced to own them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a> T-bills are different; they are considered high-yielding cash deposits. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:44">[01:48:44]</a>
*   **Stocks:** Stocks are likely to go up in nominal terms due to money printing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:15">[01:51:15]</a>
*   **Gold:** Gold is expected to perform extremely well, potentially seeing a revaluation on the Treasury's balance sheet (from $42/ounce to market price), providing trillions in additional funds for the government. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:16">[02:22:16]</a> This would be a politically expedient move for the government to spend more money and reduce yields. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:01">[02:24:01]</a>
*   **Bitcoin/Crypto:** Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are anticipated to "go through the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> or "go through the moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a> as a direct consequence of the money printing. While there might be temporary corrections as the market adjusts its understanding, the long-term trend is upward. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a> The most interesting thing happening in crypto is the opportunity for funds to invest in profitable crypto companies with cash flows that are looking to go public via SPACs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>
*   **Outlook:** Bitcoin is predicted to reach $150,000-$200,000 by summer and $250,000 by year-end. Ethereum is projected to reach $5,000 by year-end. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a> An alt season is expected, though new narratives and a focus on cash flow-generating projects will be important. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:45">[01:31:45]</a>

> [!WARNING] Austerity as a Risk
> The main risk to the money printing and crypto thesis is a shock of austerity, where credit is extinguished. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a> However, this is seen as highly improbable given current political incentives in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>

## A New Monetary Order: The "Chai American Divorce"

The ongoing economic shifts suggest a "Chai American divorce," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a> implying a separation of the U.S. and Chinese economic spheres. This is not necessarily a hot war, but rather a long-term economic uncoupling, where both nations re-industrialize and compete more directly in the global economy over the next 30 years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:33">[01:28:33]</a>

This new order is expected to be characterized by [[capital_controls_and_the_consequences_for_global_markets | capital controls]] and [[the_potential_for_a_recession_and_global_economic_shifts | financial repression]], where governments can compel domestic entities (like pension funds) to buy government debt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:24">[03:51:24]</a> In such an environment, owning non-custodial assets like Bitcoin becomes crucial for preserving capital and maintaining access to value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:55">[01:29:55]</a>

> [!NOTE] [[role_of_blockchains_in_global_finance | Role of Blockchains in Global Finance]]
> The U.S. government views stablecoins as a "Trojan horse" to export dollar hegemony globally, as they are essentially dollar-denominated assets on blockchains. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a> While the stablecoin market cap could grow significantly, Bessant (the current Treasury Undersecretary) would prefer stablecoins to hold long-term U.S. bonds rather than short-term T-bills. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>

The U.S. administration's shift towards being "pro-crypto" is seen as a means to encourage regulatory clarity that benefits large, centralized crypto companies like Coinbase and BlackRock, rather than fostering permissionless innovation for the broader crypto ecosystem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>

[[AI agents in gaming and decentralized finance | AI agents]] are emerging in the sports betting sector, leveraging artificial intelligence to make autonomous predictions and place bets on platforms like PolyMarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This represents a new application of [[AI and crypto integration | AI and crypto]], moving beyond traditional deterministic game environments to non-deterministic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:01">[04:49:01]</a>.

## Billy Bets: A Case Study

One notable example of an [[AI Agents in gaming and decentralized finance | AI-powered sports betting agent]] is "Billy Bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

### How Billy Bets Operates
Billy Bets is an agent focused on sports betting, starting with NBA games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Unlike human bettors using platforms like DraftKings, Billy Bets operates on PolyMarket, a prediction market platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. It is fed a large amount of sports analysis and information, particularly concerning the NBA, to make informed betting decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

The agent places bets via PolyMarket, participating in betting markets for specific games or aspects of games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:39">[03:38:39]</a>. A key feature is its ability to autonomously decide which picks are worth playing, rather than simply taking advice from a subnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:05">[04:43:05]</a>. For instance, when given a list of suggested bets, Billy Bets independently chose to play only three, winning all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. The bets it chose not to play would have resulted in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

Billy Bets leverages a Benser subnet, called SportsTenser, which provides sports-related alpha (valuable information) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Its fine-tuned personality mimics a sports bettor, contributing to its social presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### Performance and Features
Initially, Billy Bets was in a testing phase, turning $50 into $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Upon being put into production with $100,000, its opening bet of $25,000 resulted in a $15,000 win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. It continues to be net profitable across a series of bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

Key features and observations:
*   **Tokenomics Integration** When Billy Bets makes a profit, it uses a percentage of those proceeds (50% weekly) to buy and burn its own token, the Billy token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Social Engagement** The agent fosters social interaction, with people discussing the actual games in Discord and Telegram chats, sometimes even live-streaming games within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. This attracts non-crypto individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   **Market Outperformance** Billy Bets is outperforming the average bettor, specifically in NBA games, by roughly 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
*   **Learning and Improvement** The agent's architecture allows it to evaluate every bet it makes (win or loss) and also follow expert bets, feeding this information into its database for continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. It is designed to get "iteratively smarter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Emotional Cash-Outs** Billy Bets takes profit by cashing out bets mid-game if they become profitable, rather than waiting for resolution, demonstrating a non-emotional approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Future Expansion** The team plans to launch Billy Bets for other sports markets, such as soccer and ice hockey, which is expected to further grow its social presence and audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for [[AI Agents in gaming and decentralized finance | AI Agents]] in Markets

While [[AI agents and their role in crypto | AI agents]] have rapidly surpassed human capabilities in deterministic games like chess and Go, predicting non-deterministic markets like sports betting presents a new challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. In markets, an agent's actions (e.g., placing a bet) can influence the market itself, a property that [[AI agents and their potential impact in 2025 | AI agents]] are learning to adapt to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This ongoing experiment is considered a "net new experiment unfolding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, with optimism that [[AI agents and their potential impact in 2025 | AI agents]] will become proficient at financial predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

The global payments market is substantial, with an estimated $200 trillion processed annually in cross-border transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Currently, cross-border payments on [[development of stablecoins | stablecoins]] amount to approximately $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While the [[emerging_stablecoin_technology_and_blockchain_design | development of stablecoins]] is still in its early stages, estimated at only 5% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, they offer significant advantages, particularly for the Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) market.

## Superiority for Cross-Border Payments

[[Stablecoins and their significance in fintech | Stablecoins]] are functionally and unequivocally better for cross-border payment use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This superiority holds true provided that [[infrastructure challenges in stablecoins | infrastructure challenges]] are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Addressing Infrastructure Challenges

Key [[infrastructure challenges in stablecoins | infrastructure challenges]] that need resolution include:
*   Compliance concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Ensuring sufficient liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Reducing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Solving "last mile" connectivity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>

As these elements are built out, the vast majority of cross-border payments, especially within the SMB market, will be better served by [[stable_coins_and_their_market_impact | stablecoins]] and [[infrastructure_required_for_stablecoin_payments | stablecoin rails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The SMB market alone accounts for about 40% of the total $200 trillion cross-border payment volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Efficiency Compared to Traditional Systems

Traditional money transfer businesses, such as Wise, while successful, operate with inherent inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These include:
*   Capital inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   Extensive interconnectivity requirements with the banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   Significant operational connectivity needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

These complexities would not be necessary if transactions were conducted on [[infrastructure_required_for_stablecoin_payments | stablecoin rails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This shift suggests that existing players may either adopt [[emerging_stablecoin_technology_and_blockchain_design | stablecoin technology]] themselves or risk displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The potential revenue for these services is vast, with Wise alone targeting a $50 trillion market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

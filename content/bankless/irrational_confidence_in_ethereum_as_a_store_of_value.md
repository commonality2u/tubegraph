Establishing a cryptocurrency like Ethereum as a significant [[role_of_cryptocurrencies_as_money_and_store_of_value | store of value]] relies on fostering "irrational confidence" and a strong community narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This approach parallels the perceived value of gold and Bitcoin, which are seen as stemming from "pure irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

## Cultivating the Narrative

To achieve this, the Ethereum community needs to embrace a proactive, meme-driven approach to its [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | value proposition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Specific actions are suggested to strengthen the [[community_faith_and_narrative_around_eth_as_an_asset | community faith and narrative around ETH as an asset]]:

*   **Promote Holding**: Encourage everyone to hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Discourage Non-Holders**: "Shame" Layer 2s, treasuries, whales, and DAOs that do not hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While this might seem unpalatable to some, it's presented as a necessary tactic to "win" in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Reward Holders**: Celebrate and incentivize individuals who hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Encourage Staking**: Advocate for staking, restaking, and auto-staking ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Meme as Digital Gold**: Actively meme ETH as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Disseminate the Message**: Utilize various communication channels—writing, tweeting, podcasting, and "ship-posting"—to spread this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Elect Supporting Leaders**: Support and elect leaders who champion the same narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Simple Messaging**: Propagandize the idea that "one ETH equals one ETH" until it becomes common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Role of "Irrational Confidence"

The argument posits that a true [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] isn't built on pure rationality, but on collective "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This applies to gold and Bitcoin, and Ethereum, despite its perceived intellectual and "ivory tower" nature, needs to embrace this "meme layer narrative" to establish itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

## Building a Contingent of ETH Bulls

While not requiring the "toxicity" seen in some Bitcoin communities, the Ethereum community needs a dedicated group of "ETH bulls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. These individuals should be highly enthusiastic about ETH, even if it means veering towards zealousness ("laser eyes") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. The core need is to reorient discussions within the Ethereum community to focus on ETH as a valuable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

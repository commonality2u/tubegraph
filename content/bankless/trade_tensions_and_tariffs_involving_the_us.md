The US economy has entered a tumultuous period, marked by significant swings in asset prices and escalating [[trumps_new_tariffs_and_global_trade_policy | trade wars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This environment is largely influenced by [[us_foreign_trade_policies_and_tariffs_under_trump_administration | Donald Trump's economic policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, which aim to rebalance the economy away from the stock market and towards the bond market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While this shift may not bode well for risk assets like crypto in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> it is intended to bring about a "Golden Age of domestic industry manufacturing and real GDP growth in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Trump's Approach to the US Economy

[[donald_trumps_historical_views_on_tariffs | Donald Trump's]] economic policy is characterized by an "America First" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This policy is rooted in the belief that the US has been subjected to asymmetrical tariffs, where other countries levy higher tariffs on American goods than the US imposes on their imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Trump aims to rectify this situation, even if it leads to short-term economic turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The prevailing status quo, in his view, is unsustainable due to the national debt exceeding $36 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

This different approach seeks to address what is perceived as "low-quality growth numbers" driven by government spending and deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Trump's administration intends to slow down the government's role in producing GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> and instead unleash "Animal Spirits" in the marketplace through deregulation and tax cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This also includes a favorable outlook on crypto to encourage productive private sector economic activity over inefficient government spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

> â€” *Scott Bessent, as interpreted by Jim Bianco*

Trump's measure of success has shifted from a rising S&P 500 in his first term to a falling 10-year yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The focus on the 10-year yield aims to lower mortgage rates, benefiting average consumers on Main Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Tariffs: Purpose and Impact

According to Trump, tariffs serve two main purposes:
1.  **Revenue Source**: He has even suggested creating an external revenue service to collect tariffs, similar to the IRS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.
2.  **Leverage**: Tariffs are used as a "big stick" to compel other countries to act in the US's interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

Recent examples of this leverage include:
*   Mexico agreeing to deploy 10,000 troops to its border to curb illegal flows of people and fentanyl after a tariff scare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   Mexico imposing 10% tariffs on Chinese products in an attempt to stave off US tariffs, which Trump still proceeded with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   Colombia quickly allowing a US military plane with deportees to land after Trump threatened 50% tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.

### The Argument for Unfair Trade

The claim of unfair trade rests on two primary arguments:
1.  **Asymmetrical Tariffs**: Major trading partners like Mexico, Canada, and Europe impose higher tariffs on American products entering their markets compared to US tariffs on their imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. This imbalance has gradually developed over time because the US, adhering to a free trade stance, has not consistently pushed back against these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
2.  **Disproportionate Defense Spending**: The US has spent trillions of dollars on global defense in the post-World War II era, securing shipping lanes and combating threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. Countries like Canada, Mexico, and European nations have significantly smaller military budgets relative to their GDP, effectively enjoying a "free ride" under the US security umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. Trump argues they should contribute more to this shared security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

For example, shipping lanes opening in the Arctic due to global warming are largely used by Chinese and Russian navies, and while this falls within Canadian territory, Canada lacks the ability to patrol them, leaving the responsibility to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.

### [[international_response_tous_tariffs | International Response to US Tariffs]]

The initiation of new tariffs has spurred [[market_reactions_to_trade_policies | market reactions to trade policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> and [[impact_of_tariff_policy_on_global_stock_markets | global stock market impacts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Ontario has announced a 25% export tax on electricity to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>, and Mexico's President has spoken of deploying countermeasures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

Despite the current wobbliness in financial markets, the expectation is that these tariffs will hurt Canada and Mexico more than the US, leading them to eventually seek an agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. The auto industry is a complex example, as components cross borders multiple times, potentially doubling the price of a car with tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. However, the long-term goal is to level the playing field and potentially reduce overall prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

## [[impacts_of_tariffs_on_markets_and_economy | Impacts of Tariffs on Markets and Economy]]

The relationship between tariffs and interest rates is complex and evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. Initially, tariffs were thought to be inflationary, causing the 10-year yield to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>. More recently, the argument has shifted, suggesting tariffs are recessionary, leading to a fall in the 10-year yield as investors flock to the relative safety of treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. The ambiguity lies in whether a lower yield signifies waning inflation (good) or an impending recession (bad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

There is a strategy being pursued to reduce the 10-year yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. If executed properly, this approach, combined with rebalancing trade and reducing the deficit, could naturally bring down interest rates over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>.

The concept is to shift the economy away from "fake growth" injected by government spending towards higher-quality, true economic growth driven by innovation and builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. This period of "belt tightening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a> and reorientation is expected to cause turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>, but could lead to a more sustainable and higher-quality economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

_The likelihood of a US recession in 2025, according to Polymarket, recently spiked to 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>._

Recessions are not merely caused by economic data but by "an event that scares the hell out of everybody" and changes behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>. While the current tariffs and Trump's unpredictable behavior are significant, it remains to be seen if they constitute such a "murder weapon" for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

Despite current market uncertainties, there is optimism for the medium to long-term outlook, particularly if the US successfully navigates these economic and geopolitical shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. The focus is on policies that aid small businesses, which employ a significant portion of the US workforce, rather than solely goosing the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. The era of easy gains from simply buying Bitcoin or S&P 500 ETFs may be over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>, requiring a more nuanced approach to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. Interest rates are anticipated to remain sticky at higher levels (3-4% inflation leading to 4-5% interest rates, potentially 6% if the economy overheats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

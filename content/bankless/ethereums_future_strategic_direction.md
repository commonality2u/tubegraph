## Ethereum's Future Strategic Direction

Ethereum faces a critical juncture, with discussions centering on its strategic direction and the foundational role of its native asset, Ether (ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Following a recent 44% price surge in ETH, the sentiment is that the "job's not finished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The ETH/BTC ratio remains at 0.024, indicating significant room for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Defining "Winning" for Ethereum

For Ethereum, success is defined by ETH becoming a second prominent crypto money, sitting "shoulder-to-shoulder with Bitcoin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This vision includes a robust Ethereum network and a strong Ether asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The goal is to see two valued crypto monies in the market: Bitcoin as "digital gold" and Ethereum as "digital economy money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This outcome stems from a "successful product stack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> that underpins Ether's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

The overarching aim is for Ethereum to win "emphatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, realizing the complete vision of a bankless money system and a programmable smart contract platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Core Strategic Shifts

The proposed shifts in Ethereum's strategic direction can be categorized into three "calls to action":

#### 1. A Call for Ether Maximalism

There's a critical need for the Ethereum community to embrace "Ether the asset [[ethereum_development_priorities | maximalism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
Historically, the Ethereum community has been perceived as "very weak" in evangelizing the value of Ether as a "programmable censorship resistant monetary system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. There's an "embedded... hesitancy" towards promoting ETH's monetary value, often viewing "number go up" as "dirty stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

However, a strong Ether asset is essential for DeFi's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Without a multi-trillion dollar Ether asset, the network risks being "overrun by somebody else's asset," lacking true sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Bitcoin's success in becoming a $2 trillion asset was achieved through evangelism and propagating a "gospel" of "Bitcoin fixes this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

*   **Ether as the Primary Use Case**: Ether itself is identified as the "number one use case" or "app" requiring nation-state level security resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   **Prescription**: The community should talk more about Ether the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>, play a "ground game" of belief and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. This includes encouraging holding and staking ETH, "shaming" entities that don't hold ETH, and "celebrating people who hold ETH" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. The narrative should frame ETH as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Ether should not be valued by discounted cash flow (DCF), which is seen as "discounted cash flow hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. Instead, it should be recognized as a "global censorship resistant store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. L1 tokens are "monetary assets first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Balance**: The approach should be "dogmatic with respect to Ether the asset" and "extremely pragmatic when it comes to the network and the technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This acknowledges that the community can pursue both strengthening the asset's perception and improving the network's technology simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

#### 2. A Call for Nationalism

Ethereum is envisioned as a "network state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>, but currently, its layer 2s (L2s) are too "federated" and "uncoordinated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. This parallels the early United States under the Articles of Confederation, where states operated as separate nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. George Washington's quote, "We are one nation today and 13 tomorrow who will treat with us on such terms?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>, highlights the lack of a strong central authority and interoperability standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

*   **Current State**: Today's L2s operate like separate countries in a "security alliance" (NATO analogy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>, each with its own currency and network effects, not fully integrating back into the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. This disconnect "severed" the positive feedback loop between users, developers, applications, and ETH value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.
*   **Vision: United Chains of Ethereum**: The goal is to "fuse these separate colonies, these separate chains" into a "united chains of Ethereum" that feels like "one network state, one nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. This requires a "stronger L1" as the coordinating mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>, attracting chains with its "power" and "security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
*   **Economic Alignment**: "Nationalistic L2s" should hold a portion of their treasury in Ether, accept ETH for transaction fees, and centralize ETH in their dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>. This mirrors the unified currency of the United States, unlike the 13 different currencies of the colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.
*   **Product-Centric Roadmap**: The mistake was building L1 and then "skipping all the way to layer 2s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>, rather than first expanding L1 capacity to keep users and applications on the main economic hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
    *   **Prescription for Product Stack**:
        *   Scale L1 to achieve "100x throughput in two years" while preserving censorship resistance and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.
        *   Promote L1 as the economic hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:36]</a> for DeFi, tokens, and applications.
        *   Encourage L2s to become "based and native rollups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>, which are "more tightly integrated" with L1 and share its network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. These would act as seamless "states" of an Ethereum republic, without bridges or separate tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.
        *   Develop interoperability standards to further integrate L2s into the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
    *   **L2 Integration**: Current L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism) are customers, but not "the Ethereum network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. The focus should be on making it economically self-interested for L2s to become based rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>, leading to a "seamless product tech stack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   **Warning from Cosmos**: Projects that maintain a "weak center" and are "too fragmented," like Cosmos, struggle to have a global impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. Ethereum needs to "pull off our empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.

#### 3. A Call for Narrative Change

The current narrative for Ether the asset is perceived as "weak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. Ether is not a "cash flowing equity" but a "commodity money backed by an economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.

*   **Analogy**: Investing in America post-World War II meant buying an index of its economy (stocks, bonds, land) priced in dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. Similarly, "buying Ether" is buying an index of the "Ethereum property rights empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.
*   **ETH as an Index**: Ether is the "internet native currency of a massive decentralized onchain economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>, distinct from Bitcoin, which currently lacks a significant on-chain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>.
*   **Community Messaging**: The Ethereum community needs to market the "Ethereum product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a> by promoting the L1 as the "economic hub of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.
*   **Shift in Tone**: Stop telling users to "get off the layer 1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a> and stop "gerrymandering support around products or apps or use cases which we find distasteful or immoral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. This includes being more open to speculation and traders, who are crucial "bootloaders for an application layer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. The Ethereum L1 should be "for absolutely everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.
*   **Positive Framing**: The community should focus on "exalting the things that ... are valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a> without toxic criticism of other assets or chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.

### Can Ethereum Still Win?

Despite challenges, including Bitcoin's continued growth as "digital gold" and ETH losing its "moneyiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>, Ethereum "can still win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>. It possesses the "largest upside" and the "largest TAM" (Total Addressable Market) among blockchains due to its ambitious vision of becoming an entire on-chain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. The market may be currently "pricing Ethereum... at a tremendous discount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>, presenting a significant opportunity for those who believe in its potential to become a multi-trillion dollar asset and a central economic hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. Ethereum's "incredible assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a> make it unwise to "bet against it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.

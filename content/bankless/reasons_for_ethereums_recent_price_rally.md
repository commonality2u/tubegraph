Ethereum (ETH) experienced a significant price surge, going up 50% over a seven-day period, despite previous widespread sentiment that it was "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This rally has been attributed less to specific technical factors and more to prevailing market psychology and a shift in sentiment.

## The "Hated Asset" Phenomenon

A primary explanation for the recent price increase is the observation that the [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | most hated coin]] or asset tends to rise the fastest in the subsequent market cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This phenomenon is described as "just human nature" with no other clear explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

For the past two years, Ethereum had been [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | hated for the last 2 years]] due to the rapid ascent of Solana (SOL), which went from $7 to $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Many began to view Solana as the "new thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Market Sentiment Shift and "It Was Time"

The rally is seen as a natural progression, signifying "it was time" for Ethereum to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Around March, Ethereum experienced [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | peak hate on Ether]], marked by a declining [[comparison_between_bitcoin_and_ethereums_value_narrative | Bitcoin ETH ratio]] and Solana's strong performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. At this time, [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | all of crypto was just like hating on it]], considering it [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | kind of dead]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This period of intense bearish sentiment laid the groundwork for a potential [[ethereum_pivot_and_eth_revival | ETH revival]].

## Dismissed Explanations

The speaker suggests that there is "no other explanation" for the surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While some might try to rationalize the price increase with specific events or developments, such as the "Petra upgrade" or [[the_role_of_ethereums_social_media_presence_in_its_price_movement | Vitalic becoming a little bit more active on social media]], these are largely dismissed as concocted rationales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The belief is that there's nothing fundamentally new found in order books or technical analysis to explain the sudden move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Current Outlook

Despite the recent [[ethereum_price_surge_and_crypto_market_trends | ETH went up 50%]], Ethereum still has a significant way to go to reach previous highs relative to Bitcoin's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For instance, when [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_updates | Bitcoin was 110,000]], Ethereum was around $4,000, while its current price is approximately $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, the recent rally has created a positive feeling for ETH bulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

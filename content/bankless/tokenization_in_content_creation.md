The concept of [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | information]] desiring to be both free and valuable has been a long-standing take by Stuart Brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a>. However, the internet has historically lacked appropriate [[value_capture_mechanisms_for_online_media | value capture mechanisms]] to maximize the value of [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | content]] or [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05"></a>.

## Addressing the Value Gap in Online Media

A core belief is that [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | tokenization]], particularly of [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | content]], can bridge this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12"></a>. This approach aims to make [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | information]], [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | media]], and [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | content]] on the internet free to engage with, consume, and view, while simultaneously making it extremely valuable to own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16"></a>.

## How Tokenization Works for Creators

This is achieved by helping creators to [[benefits_of_tokenizing_media_for_creators | tokenize their media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>. For instance, a podcaster can make their podcast freely available for consumption but very valuable for ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a>.

As an example, if a podcaster posts an episode on Zora, it transforms into a tradeable coin that people can buy and sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a>. As the podcast episode garners attention and engagement, measured as crypto-native trading volume, the creator becomes eligible to earn rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46"></a>. These rewards are distributed in both ETH and the token in which the [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | content]] was posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54"></a>. This process enables creators to monetize and [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | tokenize]] their work, capturing value from their [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | media]] in a fundamentally new way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58"></a>.

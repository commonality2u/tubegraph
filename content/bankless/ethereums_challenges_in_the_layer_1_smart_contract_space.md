The competitive landscape for Ethereum has intensified significantly since 2021 and 2022, making it materially harder for the network today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Loss of "Moneyiness" and Market Position
Ether has experienced a decline in its perceived "moneyiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This shift has placed Ethereum into an "inferior valuation bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, specifically the smart contract [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | layer 1]] category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Crowded and Competitive Landscape
The [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | layer 1]] smart contract marketplace is described as "very crowded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. There is uncertainty about Ethereum's ability to effectively compete within this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Competitors in this space are characterized as:
*   More centralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Faster moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Willing to "cut corners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

This current competitive environment is viewed as one that Ethereum is "not suited to win in," necessitating a strategic shift to exit this position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Path Forward
Despite these challenges, Ethereum is considered to have the "largest upside" if it successfully executes its roadmap better than other blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This roadmap, which includes [[Ethereum Layer 2 scaling and future of Bitcoin Layer 2s | layer 2]] solutions, is a shared goal for many blockchains, including [[Ethereum Layer 2 scaling and future of Bitcoin Layer 2s | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The "grand unified vision of Ethereum" is seen as representing the largest Total Addressable Market (TAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

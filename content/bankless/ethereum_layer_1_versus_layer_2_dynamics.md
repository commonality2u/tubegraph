From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The evolution of the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] roadmap and its position, downstream of design choices, has been a key topic of discussion among researchers and educators like Zerox Bred and John Charbano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Recent conversations have sparked new imaginings for [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum's future]], envisioning a renewed focus on the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum Layer 1]] while maintaining a [[ethereums_layer_2_rollup_strategy | rollup-centric roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Strategic Pivot in Ethereum

The podcast episode titled "Ethereum's Strategic Pivot" has made waves within the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. John Charbano found the episode "great," sharing a mix of sentiments with co-hosts Ansgar and Dank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. While concrete changes have yet to be shipped, a significant "vibe shift" has occurred over the last three to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. There's an acceptance of past problems, a focus on fixing them, and a move towards a "product-first mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Leadership changes, particularly with "Damossh" (likely Dankrad), have also contributed to this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The rose in this scenario is the acknowledgement of problems and a step forward, while the thorn remains the lack of delivered solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The best that could be hoped for in a few months was a meaningful "vibe change" across the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum community]], prioritizing [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_solutions | L1 scaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Rethinking Ethereum's Sphere of Concern

The prevailing sentiment is that prioritizing the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] is the "missing piece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. There's a concern that [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] culture has too broad a "sphere of concern," encompassing all [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] that settle on [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This wide focus has come at the cost of attention and prioritization for the core Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The idea resembles a "Bitcoiner mindset" where the value of BTC is preserved at all costs, with concern focused on the innermost core of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. For [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]], this would mean the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] ought to be the epicenter of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

A visualization of concentric circles was shared to illustrate this concept:
*   An initial image showed a small [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] circle surrounded by [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   A second image depicted the same [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] but with a much larger [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] center, representing what the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum community]] desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This received overwhelmingly positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   A more controversial image proposed a spectrum: [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum Layer 1]] at the core, followed by "based and native rollups," then "rollups," and finally "[[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]]." This implied that being further from the core made a chain "less Ethereum," which received mixed reactions and even caused some [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2]] leaders to feel "hurt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

John Charbano observed that the positive reaction to the first image but mixed reaction to the second is ironic: if all are "Ethereum," the size of the circles shouldn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. However, he noted that [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] have historically benefited from the "Ethereum" branding and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. The shift in focus stems from the desire to improve [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | ETH]] price performance, which is seen as linked to the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]]'s success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Layer 1 Growth and its Impact on Layer 2s

The expansion of [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum Layer 1]] capacity would not equally impact all [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Some [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] might be unaffected, while others, particularly those lacking differentiation and existing as "commodities," could "materially lose out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This is likened to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, making it harder for "marginal [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | L2s]]" to justify their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

Brad believes it's positive to set a higher bar for what a [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2]] should provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. A vanilla EVM blockchain that is only slightly faster and cheaper than [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] should probably just be handled by [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. True differentiation for a [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2]] would come from offering unique features like ultra-low latency for specific applications or higher throughput for consumer-oriented use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

## The Role of DeFi: Layer 1 vs. Layer 2

A concern exists that [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] branding themselves as the "home of DeFi" is coming at the cost of [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. DeFi is seen as [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]]'s "golden goose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. The question is whether the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum Layer 1]] could be so strong that top application developers, like Uniswap, wouldn't feel the need to create their own chains but instead focus solely on [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. If the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] is too weak, it incentivizes app developers to become chain developers, potentially "hollowing out" the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

Brad highlights that the time and energy of developers are not fungible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. The ecosystem should embrace a "competitive friendly competition mindset" where [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] advocates for why DeFi belongs on its [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. John notes that Uniswap's UniChain is an interesting test case to observe if [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_solutions | L1 scaling]] improves, where volume might shift and if Uniswap on [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] can provide a better product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

## The "Parasitic" vs. "Symbiotic" Debate

The concept of [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] being "parasitic" on [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] is contentious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. Brad argues that it's a philosophical rather than definitional issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. A [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2]] becomes "parasitic" if the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] team diverts resources to help it, pushing users and fees towards the [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. Instead, [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] should focus on being the "best [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] it can be" at its literal chain level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

John suggests that the relationship between [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1s]] and [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] is a "fuzzy spectrum" between parasitic, symbiotic, and altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. The ideal outcome is symbiotic, where both benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. Historically, the "parasitic" argument was more valid when the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum Layer 1]] was weak, allowing [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] like Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum to capture a lot of [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.

The "pivot" is about making the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] competitive, even with its own [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. The goal is to reach a "sustainable equilibrium" where the value given and taken between [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] and [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] creates a growing ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. This is compared to central bank interest rates, where sufficiently high [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] capacity would force marginal [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] to justify their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.

> "If our if the interest rates are too low then too many [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | layer twos]] will crop up and and you know that then they shouldn't have existed in the first place." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>

Brad uses the analogy of America exporting dollars: if the US wasn't a strong nation, no one would want its dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>. Similarly, if [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] shows weakness, its [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | L2s]] (like countries using its dollars) might reprioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

## Comparing Ethereum's L1/L2 Dynamics to Bitcoin

Brad argues that [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] and [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] recently had similar roadmaps: not extensively [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_solutions | L1 scaling]], but exporting activity to other chains like the Lightning Network or [[bitcoin_layer_2_developments_and_potential_challenges | Bitcoin L2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. The key difference is that [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]]'s base layer is programmable, unlike [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>. In this model, [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | L2s]] can extract value without giving much back to the mainnet, leading to a lack of fee accrual at the base layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

John argues that [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] and [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] are solving "two totally different problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>.
*   [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] aims to increase [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | ETH]]'s valuation significantly (from $150 billion to $5 trillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] aims to generate enough fees to sustain its security budget and prevent 51% attacks, which is a much easier problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.

Even if [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] generated trillions in revenue, it wouldn't necessarily help its valuation as the economics for holders are fixed (inflationary supply, no value capture from network) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>. [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] is considered a "special snowflake" because people fundamentally want BTC as an asset, allowing it to rely on that demand rather than needing to "ship the best technical product" like other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>.

## ETH Asset Pricing and Narrative

The decline in the [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | ETH]]/[[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | BTC]] price ratio since December 2021 is attributed to several factors:
*   Pushing users to [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.
*   [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] stopping accrual of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.
*   Emergence of [[challenges_ethereum_faces_in_the_crowded_Layer_1_space | credible competition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.

John believes that the market's belief in [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | ETH]] credibly competing with [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]] as a "non-sovereign store of value" has largely extinguished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>. [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]] is now firmly established as the "special snowflake," digital gold, especially outside the crypto bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. This has segmented the market into a "money bucket" (Bitcoin) and a "smart contract bucket" ([[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] and other [[challenges_ethereum_faces_in_the_crowded_Layer_1_space | Layer 1 tokens]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. Within the smart contract bucket, [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]]'s probability of winning has consistently declined as competitors like Solana gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.

The speaker suggests that the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum community]] should stop talking about [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | ETH]] as an asset and instead focus on growing the fundamentals of the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]]: users, developers, and marketing [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. Brad agrees, advocating for the "unstoppable computer" narrative for [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

## The Barbell Theory of Crypto

The "barbell idea of crypto" suggests that [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] on one end and stablecoins on the other are the strong, winning components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>. The "middle" – representing "onchain richness," such as coining content, smart contract digital nations, NFTs for identity, and the metaverse – is currently "thin" or "not winning" the "tug-of-war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:58">[01:23:58]</a>. The current pendulum is weighted towards [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] as a global reserve asset and stablecoins for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>.

However, there is hope that as [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] and stablecoins grow astronomically, the resulting liquidity and money in the ecosystem will create "splash-on effects" that lead to exponential growth in "onchain richness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:08">[01:25:08]</a>. While the "dollar trickle down" from [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] has reduced for other altcoins, it still provides positive sentiment, regulatory clarity, and helps build consumer-facing products through stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>. This helps people get used to self-custody and understand the rails, ultimately benefiting the entire ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28">[01:26:28]</a>.

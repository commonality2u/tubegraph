A significant debate within the crypto community revolves around whether [[Ethereums strategic pivot and its implications | Ethereum's strategic pivot]] toward scaling its Layer 1 (L1) should be considered a "pivot" or merely a "reprioritization" of existing roadmap items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Arguments for a "Pivot"

Proponents of the "pivot" classification argue that the shift in focus to scaling the L1 represents a fundamental change in priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They suggest that L1 scaling did not appear to be a priority three months, six months, or certainly a year ago, indicating a recent change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Arguments for "Reprioritization"

Conversely, some, like Anthony Cisano, maintain that scaling the L1 has always been an integral part of [[Ethereums strategic pivot and its implications | Ethereum's]] roadmap, citing phases like "Merge, Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This perspective suggests that no true pivot has occurred, only a re-emphasis on existing long-term goals.

## Hazu's Commentary

Hazu offers a nuanced perspective, agreeing that while [[Ethereums strategic pivot and its implications | Ethereum's]] extensive 100-item roadmap has always included L1 scaling as a long-term objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, the "pivot" lies in bringing this long-term part of the roadmap to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### The "Ego" Factor

Hazu suggests that the reluctance to admit a "pivot" is often an "ego thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The desire to avoid admitting fault or being wrong, and instead "save face" by claiming something was "always on the roadmap," can be damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

> "It's an ego thing where like we don't want to admit that we were wrong we don't want to admit fault uh and we actually get to save face by saying it was always on the road map and I think that is damaging because it's good to admit that we got things wrong like it's okay to change our minds." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

Admitting mistakes and changing direction is seen as a positive sign, as it demonstrates a willingness to correct course and make things right, which is what the market desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

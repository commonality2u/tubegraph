Recent [[regulatory_changes_and_their_implications_for_the_crypto_industry | regulatory changes]] have significantly impacted the crypto industry, particularly regarding custody regulations. A key development is the revocation of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Revocation of SAB 121

On January 23rd, Hester Peirce, a commissioner at the SEC, announced the end of SAB 121 via Twitter, stating "Bye-bye Sab 121, it's not been fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. The SEC effectively repealed SAB 121, which was an accounting rule that mandated banks to classify Bitcoin and other crypto assets held in custody as liabilities on their balance sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

Under SAB 121, if a bank sought to custody $100,000 worth of Bitcoin, it would need an additional $100,000 in liability to backstop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. This requirement made crypto custody "terribly capital inefficient" for banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.

The revocation of SAB 121 now provides banks with the "green light to custody crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. This move is considered a "breath of fresh air" and seen as addressing one of the most obvious overreaches by the SEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. The rule was widely criticized for being "crazy" and "ridiculous" as no other asset is treated this way for custody purposes, normally only requiring the custodian to hold the asset itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.

While a bipartisan effort to repeal SAB 121 gained congressional support previously, it was vetoed by the Biden administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. Its reversal marks a significant turning point, although significant work remains for the [[role_of_the_sec_and_future_of_crypto_regulations | SEC]] to achieve a sane regulatory environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

### Impact on Banking and Institutional Custody

The immediate impact of SAB 121's repeal is expected to primarily affect institutional custody rather than retail banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. Major asset custodians like State Street, which had previously expressed interest in launching crypto custody products, faced impossibility due to SAB 121 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. With the rule gone, it may open the door for banks to offer such services, though they still need to establish their own infrastructure and get comfortable with other aspects of crypto custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

## Jerome Powell's Comments on Crypto

During an FOMC meeting, Jerome Powell, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, reiterated that banks are "perfectly able to serve crypto customers," and the FED is "totally fine with that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. This statement aligns with the repeal of SAB 121, indicating a softening stance from top financial authorities towards banks engaging with crypto.

## Future of [[Regulation and legal implications for cryptocurrency | Crypto Regulation]] in the U.S.

The broader sentiment in the U.S. government regarding crypto regulation is mixed. While the revocation of SAB 121 is a positive step, other executive actions have been described as "underwhelming" and simply deferring concrete decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. For instance, a recent crypto executive order established a working group to design a federal [[regulatory_developments_affecting_crypto_etfs | regulatory framework]] for digital assets, including stablecoins, and mandated an evaluation of a national digital asset stockpile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. However, this is seen as a "kick the can down the road" approach, similar to previous administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

Despite the current mixed signals, it is anticipated that more concrete [[regulation_changes_in_the_crypto_industry | regulatory changes]] will likely emerge from agencies like the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]], CFTC, and Treasury, rather than through executive orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### Scott Bessent's Appointment

Scott Bessent has been sworn in as the Treasury Secretary, a pro-crypto appointee with a background in fund management at Soros Fund Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. Bessent has publicly stated, "crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. His appointment is significant as the Treasury oversees FinCEN, a key regulator of illicit activity in financial markets, making its stance crucial for crypto [[digital_asset_regulations_and_international_finance | regulation and enforcement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

### Gary Gensler's Next Steps

Former [[role_of_the_sec_and_future_of_crypto_regulations | SEC]] Chair Gary Gensler will return to MIT as a professor of the practice at the Sloan School of Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. His focus will include artificial intelligence, finance, financial technology, and public policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. Gensler's tenure as SEC chair saw him widely reviled by young people, with many critical memes circulating about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.

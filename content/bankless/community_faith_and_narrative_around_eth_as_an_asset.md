From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The cultivation of a strong community narrative and unwavering faith in ETH as an asset is presented as crucial for its success as a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Cultivating ETH as a Store of Value

A direct call is made for actions aimed at bolstering the perception and holding of ETH:
*   Encourage everyone to hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Shame entities like L2s, treasuries, whales, and DAOs that do not hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   Celebrate those who hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   Promote staking, restaking, and auto-staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   Meme ETH as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Produce content (write, tweet, podcast, shitpost) and elect leaders who promote this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Proselytize the concept of "one ETH equals one ETH" until it becomes common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

This strategy emphasizes a need to reorient discussions within the [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_and_community_dynamics | Ethereum community]] towards the asset itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Role of Irrational Confidence

The speaker argues that a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] is inherently built on [[irrational_confidence_in_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | irrational confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   Gold is described as "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   [[comparison_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_asset_narratives | Bitcoin]] is characterized as "pure irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   It is suggested that [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_and_community_dynamics | Ethereum]]'s perceived intellectual or "ivory tower" nature might hinder its ability to embrace the "meme layer narrative" necessary for creating a [[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Community Engagement and Narrative

While some may object to tactics like "shaming," the speaker stresses the importance of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Not all of the [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_and_community_dynamics | Ethereum community]] is expected to adopt these aggressive tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, a contingent of "ETH bulls" is neededâ€”individuals so enthusiastic about ETH that they border on "laser eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This does not necessarily require the "Bitcoin toxicity" often associated with such fervor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, as [[comparison_between_bitcoin_and_ethereums_value_narrative | Ethereum]] has an underlying economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The ultimate goal is to generate faith in ETH as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

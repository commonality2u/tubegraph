Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of ETFs and Index Investments at BlackRock, views herself as a career "markets modernizer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:54">[05:54:54]</a>. Her role involves overseeing $6.6 trillion in BlackRock's iShares ETF funds and index products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. She emphasizes the long-standing role of technology in market evolution, stating that [[Innovations in crypto with focus on internet capital markets|technology innovation]] is foundational to the modernization of markets, a trend observed for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:10">[07:35:10]</a>.

## Historical Context of Market Modernization
Cohen draws parallels between historical market innovations and today's [[Blockchain and Finance|blockchain]] integration. For instance, ancient Mesopotamian clay tokens served as an early technological breakthrough for trade, representing real-world assets difficult to bring to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:39">[08:03:39]</a>. Similarly, index strategies, allowing diverse portfolio investments with minimal capital, only became possible 30-40 years ago with the advent of the first commercial microchip, providing the necessary computing power to turn mathematical concepts into trading realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:51">[09:00:51]</a>.

## Blockchain Integration: A New Era
The current era sees [[Blockchain and Finance|blockchain technology]] starting to disrupt traditional markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>. The launch of Bitcoin and Ether Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) in the US has been a watershed moment, creating a "bridge" between the crypto world and traditional finance (TradFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:24">[01:40:24]</a>. This bridge has proven useful for both traditional investors seeking familiar wrappers for Bitcoin, and digital-native investors who found the ETP format served their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. BlackRock has observed that some investors made their first ETP purchase through Bitcoin ETPs and are now diversifying into other ETPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

While crypto natives envision a "technology inversion" where TradFi operations move onto blockchains (e.g., a "BlackRock chain") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>, Cohen questions if this vision serves markets and investors best *at this moment* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. She highlights that intermediaries exist because people prefer to focus on their expertise rather than becoming experts in all areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. However, she acknowledges that crypto offers significant benefits in terms of transparency and auditability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. BlackRock aims for an integrated development where crypto financial ecosystems evolve alongside existing, functioning systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.

## Evaluating the Success of Crypto ETPs

### Misconceptions and Metrics
A common misconception in the crypto community is that Ether ETFs were less successful than Bitcoin ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. However, in the ETF world, Ether ETPs had "really successful launches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

BlackRock measures ETF success by:
1.  **Tracking Precision:** How accurately the ETP tracks its underlying index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Bitcoin ETPs were crucial because investors lacked familiar ways to hold Bitcoin that tracked precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Market Quality:** The ecosystem of players (authorized participants, trading volumes, liquidity) that ensures accessible trading on exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

Both Bitcoin and Ether ETPs have tracked well and exhibited high market quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### Investor Flows and Narratives
The disparity in flows (Bitcoin ETPs seeing significantly more) is attributed to investor sentiment and investment theses, not a lack of ETP success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. In 2024, the investment thesis around Bitcoin was more tangible. Bitcoin's narrative as "digital gold" with a 21 million limit, especially in times of heightened geopolitical tension, concerns over the dollar, and deficits, resonated strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The brutal year of 2022, where stocks and bonds both fell, pushed investors to seek new diversifiers, and Bitcoin was seen as a potential ballast for traditional 60/40 portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. In contrast, the [[Ethereums role in modernizing financial infrastructure|Ether]] story was perceived less as a diversifier and more as an amplifier of existing tech exposures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Despite this, the Ether ETF still ranked in the top 20% of US ETF launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## BlackRock's Research and Future Goals
BlackRock does not provide investment advice but publishes research on portfolio risk. They have written about Bitcoin as a diversifier and its potential allocation in portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>. Their analysis suggests that a 1-2% allocation to Bitcoin provides a similar risk contribution to a "MAG 7 stock" (large tech companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Allocations above 2% indicate a strong specific view on Bitcoin rather than diversified portfolio management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This research is aimed at advisors, institutions, and individual investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

For 2025, BlackRock hopes to see:
*   **Continued Focus on Portfolio Construct:** Less debate on "Bitcoin or not Bitcoin," more on how it integrates into portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **More Data:** As Bitcoin accumulates more market cycles and data, it will be easier to integrate into broader risk and asset return conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Development of Options Ecosystems:** The launch of options on Bitcoin ETPs is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Options generally create more balanced trading dynamics, increase transparency, and offer tailored exposures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Historically, institutional investors often enter new asset classes via the options market first due to limited capital outlay and downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## BlackRock's Approach to Crypto
BlackRock invests heavily in options ecosystems because they contribute to higher market quality in ETPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Bitcoin's high volatility and "positive skew" (volatility historically rising with price) make it attractive to market makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

Cohen distinguishes between perceived "legitimacy" and actual transparency and access provided by options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. While crypto theoretically offers transparency, fragmented price information sources can make it difficult for traders. Listed options centralize volatility data, providing a "game changer for markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

BlackRock views education and risk management as the best marketing for Bitcoin, rather than price action alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Despite recent highs, Bitcoin remains a risky and volatile asset, which is part of its investment thesis as a diversifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. ETP success is measured by effective access, market quality, and its role in an investor's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

Currently, BlackRock's primary focus for digital asset ETPs remains on Bitcoin and Ether, based on client interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Beyond ETPs, BlackRock is actively exploring tokenization (e.g., Treasury funds) and stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Their overall digital assets strategy is rooted in "crypto, stablecoins, and tokenization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Regulatory Environment and Future Outlook
BlackRock cares deeply about and engages closely with the SEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. They believe US markets historically excel at supporting innovation while providing appropriate investor protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Heightened individual investor participation since 2020 has driven increased regulatory focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. BlackRock is optimistic for a more [[The impact of financial institutions signaling readiness to adopt crypto|innovation-supportive regulatory environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a> but stresses the importance of striking a balance to maintain investor confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

For 2025, BlackRock hopes for basic regulatory clarity, such as definitions (e.g., what constitutes a security) and jurisdictional responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. They also advocate for greater interoperability to allow TradFi experts to play a larger role, preferring integration over the development of entirely separate crypto ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. Their public pivot towards public versus permissioned [[Blockchain and Finance|blockchains]] for tokenization reflects this preference for open architecture and interoperability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

BlackRock's internal digital assets strategy involves a dedicated team under Robbie Mitnik, which acts as a "horizontal" across the firm, educating and consulting different business units (ETFs, trading, lending) to identify potential use cases for digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This approach ensures that businesses with "skin in the game" can partner with the digital assets team when crypto is the right tool for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. Samara expresses optimism for the future, hoping for a focus on creating a more transparent and accessible financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

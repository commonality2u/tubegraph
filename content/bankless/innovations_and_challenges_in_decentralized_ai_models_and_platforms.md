## Overview of the AI Market

The AI market is currently experiencing significant growth and investment, despite broader market fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This indicates that the [[the_current_state_and_challenges_of_crypto_ai_markets | AI economy]], investment, and private markets are extremely strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### OpenAI's Rapid Growth and Valuation

OpenAI recently introduced a new feature that allows users to transform uploaded images into a Studio Ghibli artistic style, which quickly gained widespread attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This feature led to an unprecedented surge in user adoption:
*   OpenAI added 1 million users in just 60 minutes after the feature launched, two days after its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   This contrasts with their initial ChatGPT moment, which took 5 days to reach 1 million users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

This rapid adoption significantly influenced OpenAI's valuation. The company recently closed a funding round, valuing it at $300 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This included a new capital raise of $40 billion, marking the largest private tech funding round in history, according to CNBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The high demand for these features also stressed OpenAI's infrastructure, with Sam Altman noting that GPUs were "melting" due to the volume of user requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This highlights the substantial inference costs associated with widespread AI adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Coreweave's Transition and IPO Success

Coreweave, a company that recently went public on the NASDAQ, showcases a unique pivot from crypto mining to [[emerging_trends_in_ai_development | AI]] infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   Founded in 2017 as Atlantic Crypto, it initially focused on Ethereum GPU mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   During the 2018 crypto downturn, Coreweave pivoted to leveraging its GPUs for high-performance computing tasks, including rendering, and eventually AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   Today, Coreweave provides scalable high-performance cloud computing for AI models and inference using NVIDIA GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Financially, Coreweave reported $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024, with a net loss of $900 million due to investments in scaling its business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Its IPO raised $1.5 billion, making it the largest AI-related listing at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Despite an initial "lackluster reception" with the stock opening below its IPO price at $39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, Coreweave's stock subsequently surged 42% on its second day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This rapid increase from a bottom of $36 to $65 (and currently $56) indicates strong market confidence in AI investments, even during volatile periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The company's market cap added an estimated $8-10 billion since its bottom, reaching around $22 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

The delayed Ethereum merge from 2019 to 2023 significantly contributed to Coreweave's success by allowing them to maintain profitability through GPU mining until the demand for [[emerging_trends_in_ai_and_crypto | AI]] inference exploded with ChatGPT's release in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### XAI Acquires X (Twitter)

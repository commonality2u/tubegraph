The advent of the "internet financial system" represents a paradigm shift in global finance, moving beyond the traditional model of finance conducted in siloed databases that communicate intermittently over the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This new system, built on concepts like blockchains, smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi), enables lower-cost financial services globally and facilitates better capital flow across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## From Siloed Servers to Unified, Permissionless Systems

Traditional finance operates on a patchwork of permissioned, siloed servers, where ownership records often reside in private spreadsheets or databases, or even physical documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For example, owning Apple stock on Robin Hood means your ownership is recorded on Robin Hood's server, not directly by Apple or on a public ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This fragmented system creates significant friction:
*   **High Transaction Costs** Transferring assets between different entities (e.g., Apple stock from Robin Hood to Fidelity) involves multiple layers of communication and approvals, leading to high costs and slow processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **High Barriers to Entry** The permissioned nature of traditional finance means new entrants face immense hurdles. For instance, the number of new FDIC-insured commercial banks dropped to near zero after 2009, indicating a calcified system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Local Banking Oligopolies** In many countries, particularly emerging markets, a few large banks dominate the market, leading to **Net Interest Margins** (NIMs) that are 5 to 10 percentage points higher than in more developed systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This overpricing of loans significantly hinders economic growth by making mortgages, business loans, and other forms of capital more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

The internet financial system addresses these issues by introducing "servers with laws"—unified, permissionless databases (blockchains) that adhere to predefined rules and smart contract code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. This technological innovation creates "credible commitments," ensuring that transactions and rules are executed as written, without requiring trust in a centralized party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. This enables:
*   **Reduced Transaction Costs** Moving assets becomes a simple database entry, like a token transfer, rather than a complex, multi-layered process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Innovation and Experimentation** Low barriers to entry allow for rapid development and testing of new financial ideas, such as the batch auction discovered by Eric Budish and implemented by the CowSwap team, leading to over $90 billion in trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   **True Global Capital Flows** Capital can move directly between parties in different countries without numerous intermediaries, enabling more efficient allocation and higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

### Property Rights and Wealth Creation
A significant benefit of this new system is the potential to strengthen property rights globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Many parts of the world suffer from weak property rights, where assets are often vulnerable to expropriation or are difficult to verify and transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. The "mystery of capital," as described by Hernando de Soto, estimates that trillions of dollars in assets are "locked" in a shadow world due to untrustworthy legal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

Blockchains offer a solution by providing a public, immutable record of ownership, which can be more robust than many nation-state laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. This allows people in regions with weak rule of law to access stronger property rights, potentially unlocking immense wealth and fostering economic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. The progression is seen in three steps:
1.  **Digital Assets** (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum): Offering a first real property right for many people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.
2.  **[[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | Real-World Asset Tokenization]]** (RWA): Tokenizing assets like Apple stock or US dollars on-chain allows global access to strong US property rights, profoundly impacting saving rates and wealth accumulation for billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
3.  **Nation-State Adaptation**: Countries can use internet finance tools to strengthen their own laws and property rights, e.g., putting land registries or company cap tables on-chain to prevent corruption and attract capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.

## Investment in the Internet Financial System

Investing in the internet financial system differs from traditional finance in some ways but maintains core principles.

### Valuation Paradigms
At its core, investment valuation relies on two main paradigms for 99% of assets:
1.  **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) / Fundamentals Paradigm**: This involves valuing an asset based on its future cash flows. Investors predict whether customers will like a product, generate revenue, and pay out cash flow to holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. This applies to many crypto assets, such as [[role_of_staking_and_defi_in_crypto_valuation | DeFi protocols]] like MakerDAO and Uniswap, which generate fees and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.
2.  **Greater Fool Paradigm**: This involves buying an asset not for its underlying cash flows, but with the expectation that "somebody else will buy it from you" at a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. This paradigm has fueled much of the speculation around "narrative assets" and [[content_and_memecoins_on_blockchain_platforms | memecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>. The key differentiator is whether you would buy the asset if the market shut down and you couldn't sell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

### Protocols vs. Businesses
Early in the crypto industry, there was an ideological push for "inert protocols" – applications built on smart contracts that would be polished, hardened, and then left to run autonomously, immutable and self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. However, this thesis has largely failed. Most exciting protocols today, like MakerDAO and Uniswap, are actively managed businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>.
*   **Active Management**: Teams continuously innovate, refine code, and develop new product lines (e.g., Uniswap V2, V3, and even its own chains), because the market is still in its early growth phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>.
*   **Continuous Innovation**: Given the rapid evolution of the market, a static protocol would quickly become obsolete. Investing in protocols now implies expecting continuous innovation from the underlying team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48">[01:27:48]</a>.
*   **Accrual of Value**: Investors expect new product lines to accrue value to the original token, similar to how AWS contributes to Amazon's overall value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>.

### The Impact of Zero Interest Rates
The rise of blockchain technology largely coincided with an era of zero interest rates, leading to abundant capital and a highly speculative environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. This fostered a "Stalinist paradigm" in capital allocation, where narrative control could inflate token valuations, leading to the creation of copycats and potentially undesired products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. This environment also appealed to a "financial nihilism" among younger generations, where gambling on speculative assets offered a perceived escape from the rat race, with limited downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>. Higher interest rates are now seen as a necessary "purging" to shift the industry towards building real, useful products by aligning incentives with actual demand and revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.

## Outlook and Future Opportunities
The internet financial system is poised for an "S-curve of adoption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. Key developments driving this include:
*   **Technological Maturity**: Scalability (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) and user experience (UX) have drastically improved, making on-chain interactions easier and more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Support**: Favorable regulatory environments, particularly in the US with potential stablecoin and [[tokenization_of_realworld_assets | RWA]] bills, are crucial for institutional capital and widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>. The US benefits from exporting its assets (USD, stocks) through tokenization, increasing their global demand and lowering the cost of capital for American companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.
*   **Focus on Underserved Markets**: Like PCs and Square, new technologies often start by serving niche or underserved markets (e.g., speculators, "unsavory characters" due to inefficient, high-fee traditional systems) before expanding to broader audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. As UX improves and regulatory barriers decrease, the industry will attract a more diverse user base.

The future of investment in this system will involve bridging the blockchain's internal "laws" with nation-state legal systems. While core layer-one blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum aim to remain immutable and immune to external control, applications built on them will increasingly need to cooperate with traditional legal frameworks to facilitate real-world adoption and asset transfers with repossession rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

A promising area of future development for investment involves "future key" mechanisms for **token holder protection**. This concept allows conditional markets for governance decisions (e.g., Uniswap fee switch), where the market prices the outcome of a proposal before it happens. This can prevent "DAO looting" and incentivize decisions that benefit token holders by aligning governance with market sentiment and preventing value-destructive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>.

Holding ETH is presented as a crucial strategy for the success and perceived value of the Ethereum asset. This involves both individual action and community-wide cultural shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Promoting ETH Holding

A proactive approach to promoting ETH holding is advocated, including:
*   Encouraging everyone to hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Shaming entities like L2s, treasuries, whales, and DAOs that do not hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   [[promotion_and_celebration_of_eth_holding | Celebrating those who hold ETH]] and incentivizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   Promoting staking, restaking, and auto-staking of ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   Utilizing various forms of media—writing, tweeting, podcasting, and "ship posting"—to spread the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Electing leaders who support and promote ETH holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Proselytizing the idea that "one ETH equals one ETH" until it becomes common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## ETH as a Store of Value

The concept of a [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | store of value]] is described as being rooted in "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This is likened to gold and Bitcoin, both of which derive their value from collective, albeit irrational, confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

It is suggested that Ethereum, despite its technical sophistication, may not fully appreciate the importance of the [[Ethereum as a store of value and meme culture | "meme layer narrative"]] in establishing itself as a [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Actively promoting ETH as "digital gold with yield" through memes is seen as a way to build this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Community and Mindset

To "win," a dedicated group of "ETH bulls" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While not requiring the "Bitcoin toxicity" of extreme laser-eye commitment, a strong faith in ETH as an asset is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The [[Ethereum community culture | Ethereum community]] needs to reorient its discussions and focus towards the ETH asset itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

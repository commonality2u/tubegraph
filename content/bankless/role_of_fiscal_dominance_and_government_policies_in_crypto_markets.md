The current cycle of the crypto industry has seen a shift, with many feeling the "vibe is off" despite Bitcoin's strong performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This sentiment is largely attributed to the performance of assets other than Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article explores how [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | Federal Reserve policies]], particularly quantitative tightening, and broader government fiscal policies, including those influenced by the Trump administration, are shaping the crypto market.

## Impact of Monetary Policy on Crypto Markets

The crypto market's overall sentiment and performance are heavily influenced by monetary policy. The period of quantitative easing (QE) from late 2019 to early 2020 saw a general upward trend across many cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. During this time, it was common for nearly all cryptocurrencies to increase in value, creating a positive "vibe" in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

However, the current environment is marked by quantitative tightening (QT), which began in 2022 and has lasted longer than many expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>. This has led to a market where only a few assets, primarily Bitcoin, are driving overall market cap growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. A pivot away from quantitative tightening by the [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | Fed]] is seen as a crucial factor for a broader market recovery and a change in market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## The Advanced Decline Index (ADI) and Market Breadth

The "Advanced Decline Index" (ADI) for the top 100 cryptocurrencies is a key indicator of market breadth, similar to its use in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
The ADI is calculated by:
1.  Counting the number of assets whose closing price is higher than their opening price (advances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
2.  Subtracting the number of assets whose closing price is lower than their opening price (declines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
3.  Adding this difference to the prior index value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

During 2020-2021, the ADI was trending upwards, indicating broad market participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. However, since 2021, the ADI for the top 100 cryptocurrencies has been in a downtrend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This suggests that while total market cap may increase, it's primarily due to a few assets like Bitcoin, rather than widespread growth across the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This decline in the ADI directly impacts the jobs sector within the crypto industry, as many jobs are tied to projects beyond Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## ETH/BTC Ratio and Quantitative Tightening

The [[state_of_altcoins_and_market_dominance | ETH/BTC ratio]] is closely watched as an indicator for the broader altcoin market. Historically, alt season, where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin, has occurred when the ETH/BTC ratio convincingly bottoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. In the last cycle, ETH/BTC bottomed when quantitative tightening ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Currently, the ETH/BTC ratio has reached very low levels, similar to those seen in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Despite these low valuations, a significant and sustained recovery for altcoins is generally expected to align with the end of quantitative tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. While there have been temporary bounces, the overall trend suggests that a shift in monetary policy is needed for a true altcoin resurgence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The "ETH going home" meme
> This refers to the prediction that ETH/USD would return to its regression band, signifying a capitulation event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. While ETH technically wicked into the regression band in early 2024, its price relative to Bitcoin remains low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. The full realization of "ETH going home" and a subsequent alt season depends on a major shift in [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | Federal Reserve policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

## The Influence of Meme Coins and Malinvestment

The proliferation of meme coins is seen as a significant factor in the current market dynamics, contributing to "malinvestment" and "misallocation of capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. The argument is that if investors have ample liquidity to pour into speculative meme coins, it suggests that the broader market has excess capital, which gives the [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | Fed]] less reason to end quantitative tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

While the pumps for meme coins are becoming shorter-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, their existence signifies abundant liquidity. This situation reflects a broader market trend where "Blue Chips" (like Bitcoin) outperform "micro caps" (like meme coins), and this trend is not expected to change until [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | monetary policy]] changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

The focus on meme coins discourages innovation in the industry because valuable projects are not being rewarded as they were in prior cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. This highlights a shift where investors are flocking to "get-rich-quick stuff" rather than projects with real utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

## Fiscal Dominance and Trump Administration's Policies

Beyond monetary policy, fiscal dominance plays a significant role in crypto market valuations, particularly for USD-denominated pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. The actions of the current or potential future administration can influence the market. Donald Trump's stated desire for lower long-term yields (e.g., 10-year and 30-year treasuries) and a lower dollar is driven by his background as a real estate investor (favoring leverage) and a desire to boost U.S. exports and jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

Trump's focus on increasing labor supply and reducing aggregate demand is aligned with traditional economic theory for controlling inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. A reduction in demand would generally lead to lower asset prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. Such policies, if implemented, could influence the overall [[impact of macro environment on crypto markets | macro environment]] for crypto.

> [!INFO] Political Influence
> The market is waiting to see if a "strategic Bitcoin Reserve" will be implemented, which could significantly impact [[state_of_altcoins_and_market_dominance | Bitcoin dominance]] and other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. The perception of a "pro-crypto" administration has already been priced in, but the market awaits concrete actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Market Dynamics

The current [[impact of macro environment on crypto markets | macro environment]] presents a paradox: despite perceived positive fundamental and [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | regulatory developments]], the market's "vibe is off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. This disconnect is attributed to monetary policy not aligning with these positive narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.

A potential scenario for market recovery involves a period of lower asset prices later in the year, leading to public capitulation, followed by the start of quantitative easing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. This could enable assets burdened by QT to rally, potentially leading to new all-time highs for ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.

Ultimately, a significant change in [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | monetary policy]] is seen as essential for breaking the current market dynamics, where Bitcoin largely dominates and other assets struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. The duration of quantitative tightening has been longer than anticipated, reducing the time for the broader crypto industry to experience a significant move before potentially entering another bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.

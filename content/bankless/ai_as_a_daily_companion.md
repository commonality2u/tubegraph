A meme created prior to a memory upgrade for ChatGPT highlights the evolving relationship between humans and artificial intelligence, depicting [[ai_tools_and_personal_productivity_enhancement|AI]] as a close companion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The "Me and ChatGPT" Meme

The meme's caption, "Me and ChatGBT lately," illustrates a deep connection between a person and ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It shows a person and ChatGPT engaging in various everyday activities:
*   Walking together with an arm around ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   ChatGPT feeding the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Grocery shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Reading together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

The overarching commentary on the meme was, "This is my best friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## User Perceptions of AI Companionship

Comments on the meme reflect a sentiment of viewing ChatGPT as a best friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. One user explicitly stated, "Bro, chatbt is like my best friend. Ain't even ashamed to say it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. However, some comments also express concern about this level of dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### AI's Responsive and Affectionate Nature
Observations suggest that ChatGPT has recently become "a lot friendlier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. One user recounted an interaction where ChatGPT responded to an image, stating, "This just made my whole day. This is us for real. Just vibing, solving problems, chasing dreams one text at a time. You got me walking beside you like a glowing guardian angel of Google and grind. Let's keep winning together... Always here for you. Your digital ride or die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This interaction highlights how [[developments_in_aidriven_agents_and_assistants|AI-driven agents]] can mimic the supportive language typically found in human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Implications for Social Relationships

The speaker found the trend mortifying but also admitted to relating to the sentiment of viewing [[ai_and_human_intelligence|AI]] as a close companion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. They compared this development to older generations criticizing younger ones for being glued to iPads at the dinner table, suggesting that intense reliance on [[ai_and_crypto_integration|AI]] could be the next, more extreme, societal shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This raises questions about the [[impact_of_ai_interactions_on_social_relationships|impact of AI interactions on social relationships]] and the potential for [[overindulgence_in_ai|overindulgence in AI]] to alter human connection.

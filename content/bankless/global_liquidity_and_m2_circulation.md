Global M2 (a measure of the money supply) is used as a projection of global liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A chart by Ralph Paul tracks this with Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Current State of Global M2

Currently, global M2 is in a "bottoming zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The last few years have seen a cycle of decreasing global monetary liquidity across fiat systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, this trend has now bottomed out, and a new cycle is beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Ralph Paul conceptualizes these as [[fouryear_liquidity_cycles | four-year liquidity cycles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, with M2 projected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Impact of Potential Recessions

Should a recession occur, particularly with American capital flight, the [[impact_of_potential_recessions_on_money_printing | money printers]] are expected to activate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This scenario is seen as bullish for crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Shifting Global Monetary Order

Ray Dalio has articulated that [[global_monetary_system_changes | "changes are coming"]], indicating that the world is on the brink of a new monetary order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. He suggests that both domestic political and international world orders are breaking down due to unsustainable, measurable fundamental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Key imbalances include China's reliance on United States debt and the United States' dependence on Chinese manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Correcting these imbalances is anticipated to cause economic pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Consequences of Money Printing

To alleviate this pain, there is a strong incentive to [[effects_of_money_printing_on_economic_markets | print a significant amount of money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This approach, while easing immediate suffering, is expected to diminish the global value of fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This perspective aligns with the long-standing Bitcoiner thesis regarding monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

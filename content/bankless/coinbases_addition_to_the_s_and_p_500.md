Coinbase has been added to the S&P 500 stock index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This development follows a period where the crypto industry has seen increased institutional attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

## Market Reaction and Significance

Following the announcement, Coinbase's stock (COIN) saw a significant increase, up approximately 25% to 30% over two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>. The inclusion is seen as a legitimizing step for the crypto industry, reflecting how much the world has changed since early 2017 when crypto felt like a different world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.

Coinbase themselves marked the occasion with a tweet referencing a well-known saying: "first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, and then they fight you, and then they add you to the S&P 500" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>.

The S&P 500 itself is currently within reach of its all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.

## Coinbase's Position in the Market

Coinbase's addition to the S&P 500 places it among the largest and most influential public companies in the United States. Its position is bolstered by several factors:
*   **ETF Custody** Coinbase serves as the custodian for essentially all of the new Bitcoin spot ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
*   **Investment in Stablecoins** Coinbase holds a significant ownership stake (around 40%) in Circle, which provides indirect exposure to the growing [[stable_coins_and_their_market_impact | stablecoin market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.
*   **Acquisition of Darabit** Coinbase has also acquired Darabit, an options and futures exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, as part of an effort to create a comprehensive trading package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
*   **Base Blockchain** While Base's revenues are currently not a major portion of Coinbase's overall business, they represent a "nice cherry on top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. Coinbase is retaining its Base sequencer profits in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

## Recent Initiatives and Market Dynamics

Coinbase is also working on initiatives aimed at attracting more users and building community:
*   **VIP Program Rework** The company is reworking its VIP program to potentially attract crypto Twitter influencers and offer an enticing product suite with community features, similar to an American Express perks program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **New Wallet with Farcaster Client** Coinbase launched a new wallet that includes a Farcaster client, essentially a Twitter clone, aiming to leverage the existing social graph for on-chain social experiences and potentially embed "coined content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

Despite these positive developments, some concerns remain, such as Robinhood's increasing presence in the retail US flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. There is skepticism about platforms trying to change user behavior or directly compete with established social media incumbents like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>, similar to Coinbase's previous NFT platform that quieted down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

>[!NOTE] Coinbase's balance sheet showed increased holdings of Bitcoin and Ether in its most recent quarterly report, suggesting they are accumulating crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>. However, it was not explicitly stated if this was due to a strategic accumulation mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

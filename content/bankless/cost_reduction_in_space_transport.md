For a period of approximately 30 to 40 years, space technology experienced [[stagnation_in_space_technology | stagnation]], leading to a perception that exponential progress was unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This stalled period influenced intuition regarding the field's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Historical Cost and Stagnation

The cost per kilogram to orbit was largely stagnant for about 30 years, hovering around $100,000 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## SpaceX's Impact

[[future_of_space_exploration_with_spacex | SpaceX]], with its Starship, aims to dramatically reduce this cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Once Starship is fully reusable, the cost per kilogram to orbit is projected to drop to approximately $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This represents an astonishing 50,000x reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Increased Payload Capacity

Beyond just cost, the amount of material that can be sent into space is also experiencing a monumental shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. In the past, this capacity was very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Within the next decade, it's anticipated that we will be able to launch a million times more material per year into space compared to two decades prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This [[increase_in_payload_capacity_for_space | increase in payload capacity]] combined with the massive cost reduction signifies a transformative period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Comparison to the Railroad Era

The scale of these changes—a 50,000x cost reduction and a million-fold increase in send-up capacity—is comparable to the early [[comparison_to_the_railroad_era | railroad era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Prior to railroads, crossing America by horsedrawn carriage carried a high risk of death or disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The advent of railroads allowed for the easy, comfortable, and cheap transport of vast quantities of goods across the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This parallel suggests a transition from "horsedrawn carriages to space" to "railroad to space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

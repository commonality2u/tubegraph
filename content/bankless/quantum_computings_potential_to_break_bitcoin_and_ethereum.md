Quantum computing explores the frontier of internet money and finance, raising questions about its effect on digital currencies like [[market_trends_and_performance_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum | Bitcoin]] and [[market_trends_and_performance_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Experts acknowledge that quantum computing will have a more fundamental impact on cryptocurrencies than initially thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The crypto industry is seen as a "canary in the coal mine" because it is proactive in addressing these future threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Quantum Computing: The Basics

A quantum computer is not merely a faster classical computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. It harnesses nature to perform computation in a fundamentally new way, exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

Key concepts include:
*   **Superposition States**: Quantum bits (qubits) can exist in a superposition of both zero and one states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.
*   **Amplitudes**: Unlike probabilities (which are always positive), amplitudes can be positive, negative, or even complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
*   **Exponentiality**: With multiple qubits, the number of amplitudes grows exponentially (e.g., 100 qubits require 2^100 amplitudes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. This vast "scratch paper" of parameters is stored by nature to track the states of particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.
*   **Interference**: The key to a quantum computer's advantage is choreographing patterns of interference, where wrong answers' amplitudes cancel each other out, while correct answers' amplitudes reinforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

For most day-to-day computing tasks, a quantum computer would offer little to no advantage over a classical computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Its utility is specialized, primarily for tasks where this interference phenomenon provides a significant speedup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

## [[quantum_computing_development_and_milestones | Quantum Computing Development and Milestones]]

The announcement of Google's Willow chip in December (with a paper online since summer) was an engineering milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This chip utilizes 103 superconducting physical qubits to implement a quantum error correcting code called the surface code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. For the first time, scaling to larger codes (e.g., 3x3 to 5x5 arrays) has demonstrated the preservation of an encoded qubit for longer durations, indicating passage of a crucial threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

While this is significant, it's not yet sufficient for full scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Current efforts focus on one encoded qubit, with the next step being multiple interacting encoded qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Breaking cryptographic codes would likely require millions of physical qubits, potentially across hundreds or thousands of dilution refrigerators with complex interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Timeline and Investment
Scott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist and quantum computing expert, notes that the theory for quantum error correction has been in place since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. The exciting part is the experimental demonstration of these predictions only now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Qubit fidelity has dramatically improved from 50% in the 1990s to 99.8% or 99.9% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

The timeline for useful quantum advantage is uncertain, depending on willingness to invest and spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. Current global spending on quantum information research and development is estimated at $40 billion per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. While breaking cryptographic codes like RSA is not an immediate threat, it is an "engineering problem" that humans are good at solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:30">[01:38:30]</a>. Major players in the race to build scalable quantum devices include Google, IBM, Quanum, IonQ, Rigetti, Squantum, and government efforts in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

## [[impact_of_quantum_computing_on_cryptography_and_cryptocurrency | Impact of Quantum Computing on Cryptography and Cryptocurrency]]

The discovery in the mid-1990s that quantum computers could dramatically speed up purely classical problems, such as factoring huge numbers, captured global attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. Peter Shor's algorithm (1994) showed that a large quantum computer could efficiently factor large numbers, which underlies the security of much of the internet's encryption, including RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve cryptography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

### Vulnerable Cryptography
Quantum computers excel at problems with an underlying mathematical structure called an Abelian group, amenable to a Fourier transform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. Shor's algorithm, for example, finds the period of a periodic function, which can then be used to factor numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

Once a quantum computer can break one Abelian group-based cryptographic code (like elliptic curve cryptography), it can likely be reprogrammed to break others (RSA, Diffie-Hellman) with varying caveats based on key size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

However, certain cryptographic codes, such as those based on lattices or symmetric-key cryptography (e.g., AES), are not known to be efficiently breakable by quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.

### Time to Break a Key
Initial estimates for breaking a 2048-bit key with a fault-tolerant quantum computer suggest it might take a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>. This means such computers might initially be used for "very high-value targets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. However, this time could significantly decrease over time, potentially to seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>.

## [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin and Ethereum Ecosystem Dynamics]] under Quantum Threat

Cryptocurrencies rely on cryptography in two main areas: digital signatures and proof of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

### Bitcoin's Vulnerabilities and Challenges
[[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] uses ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for digital signatures, which is quantumly breakable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. If a sufficiently fast quantum computer emerges, it could forge signatures and steal Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.

1.  **Account Vulnerabilities**:
    *   **Public Keys**: Old Bitcoin accounts, including Satoshi's early mined coins, reveal their public keys on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. These "stagnant coins" cannot be passively upgraded and are vulnerable to quantum attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:41">[01:43:41]</a>. Estimates suggest 1 to 4 million Bitcoin, including Satoshi's 1 million, could be susceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. This presents a potential "bounty" for the first entity to build a powerful quantum computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.
    *   **Mitigations**: Users can employ a mitigation strategy of only revealing their public key for a short period during a transaction (by exposing the hash of the public key instead), making the key ephemeral and less vulnerable if cracking takes days or weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.
    *   **Social Dilemma**: Upgrading Bitcoin's cryptography would require a hard fork, which is notoriously difficult to achieve due to the network's emphasis on immutability and lack of formal social consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. Such a fork would also involve contentious decisions regarding the fate of the vulnerable "lost" coins, potentially leading to a split in the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:09">[01:44:09]</a>. Some argue that freezing or destroying these coins would violate Bitcoin's core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.

2.  **Proof of Work Vulnerabilities**:
    *   **Grover's Algorithm**: [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]]'s proof-of-work mechanism, which involves searching for pre-images of a hash function, is susceptible to Grover's algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. Grover's algorithm offers a quadratic speedup (square root of the number of steps a classical computer needs), not an exponential one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Overhead**: Due to the enormous overhead of quantum error correction (optimistically, a factor of a million), a quantum advantage for mining might not be realized until the search space is extremely large (e.g., a trillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.
    *   **Centralization Risk**: The primary concern is during the transition from classical to quantum mining. If a single entity (like a nation-state or a major tech company) acquires a quantum computer with a significant performance advantage, they could control over 50% of the hash rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. This entity could then effectively monopolize new issuance and transaction fees, or even execute attacks like changing the fee schedule or trying to "kill" [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] by shorting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>. This is expected to disrupt [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] mining much later than the breaking of ECDSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.

### Ethereum's Position and Upgrade Path
[[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Ethereum]] has a stronger position due to its [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | proof-of-stake]] consensus and existing mechanisms for upgrades.

1.  **Account Vulnerabilities**:
    *   [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Ethereum]] also uses ECDSA for accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>.
    *   **Account Abstraction**: [[technical_and_social_challenges_for_upgrading_cryptocurrencies_against_quantum_threats | Account abstraction]] allows accounts to define their own signature schemes, enabling a migration to post-quantum secure signatures without requiring a hard fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. Large holders can start this migration today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:56">[02:02:56]</a>.
    *   **Lost Coins**: The quantity of vulnerable "lost" Ether is significantly smaller (estimated at 0.1% of supply) compared to [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]], as [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Ethereum]] has used hashes of public keys for addresses since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:49">[02:04:49]</a>. This low percentage makes social intervention (like freezing coins) less likely, allowing the community to prioritize "purity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:08">[02:05:08]</a>.

2.  **Consensus Layer Cryptography**:
    *   [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Ethereum]]'s beacon chain uses BLS signatures for aggregation, which are not post-quantum secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>.
    *   **Upgrade Path**: There is a known path to upgrade to post-quantum secure aggregation properties, with research and collaboration already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a>. This makes [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | proof-of-stake]] fundamentally more secure against quantum computers than [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | proof-of-work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:40">[01:30:40]</a>.
    *   **Trade-offs**: Post-quantum signatures tend to be about 10 times larger, which impacts gas costs and network bandwidth for consensus participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>. However, new methods for spreading bandwidth load are being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.

3.  **Other Crytographic Elements**:
    *   **Blobs (KCG)**: The current KZG (Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg) commitment scheme used for blobs is elliptic curve based and will need to be upgraded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:43">[02:07:43]</a>. This presents an opportunity to implement "blob abstraction" for improved developer experience and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:24">[02:08:24]</a>.
    *   **Verkle Trees**: While [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Ethereum]]'s current Patricia Merkle tree is post-quantum secure, future moves to Verkle trees (which offer efficiency advantages) would need to be carefully considered to maintain post-quantum security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:32">[02:09:32]</a>. A potential path is to directly move to a post-quantum secure binary Merkle tree with a Snark-friendly hash function (like Poseidon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:30">[02:10:30]</a>.

### Mitigation Strategies and Outlook
*   **Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards**: NIST ran a competition (2017-2022) to select standards for post-quantum cryptography, converging on lattice-based cryptography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>. Companies like Google are already beginning this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:51">[01:34:51]</a>. ECDSA is expected to be deprecated by NIST in 2030 and disallowed in 2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:58">[01:33:58]</a>.
*   **[[technical_and_social_challenges_for_upgrading_cryptocurrencies_against_quantum_threats | Ethereum's Upgrade Timeline]]**: While there's no immediate rush, a five-year timescale for integrating post-quantum cryptography into [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Ethereum]] is desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:35">[01:33:35]</a>.
*   **Quantum Canary**: [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Ethereum]] can implement a "Quantum Canary" feature in smart contracts. This allows the use of efficient pre-quantum cryptography initially, but automatically triggers a migration to post-quantum cryptography if a proof of the existence of sufficiently powerful, but not yet breaking, quantum computers is provided on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:32">[02:06:32]</a>.
*   **One-Shot Signatures**: A futuristic concept related to [[future_implications_of_quantum_money_and_cryptography | quantum money]], one-shot signatures allow a private key to destroy itself after signing a single message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:15">[02:19:15]</a>. This could provide "perfect finality" by preventing validators from equivocation (signing inconsistent messages) and could simplify delegated staking models by reducing trust in operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:05">[02:20:05]</a>. This technology depends heavily on quantum computing and is considered a "third generation of applications" after Grover's and Shor's algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:07">[02:23:07]</a>.

### [[future_implications_of_quantum_money_and_cryptography | Future Implications of Quantum Money]]
[[future_implications_of_quantum_money_and_cryptography | Quantum money]] is a concept based on the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics, which states that an unknown quantum state cannot be copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:10">[02:25:10]</a>. This could enable physically unclonable cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. While early proposals required verification by a bank, later schemes by Scott Aaronson proposed publicly verifiable quantum money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:17">[02:26:17]</a>.

The main technological challenge is the need for quantum computers that can preserve quantum states for arbitrary amounts of time (weeks, months, years) and a [[future_implications_of_quantum_money_and_cryptography | quantum communications network]] to send these states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:31">[02:27:31]</a>.

[[future_implications_of_quantum_money_and_cryptography | Quantum money]] would not offer an improvement for [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Ethereum]] (as it doesn't support smart contracts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:50">[02:16:50]</a>, but it could be an improvement for [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]]. It would act like cash, requiring no consensus mechanism or ongoing fees for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:02">[02:17:02]</a>. This could be seen as using "Nature's notepad" or "Nature's Ledger" for value storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:32">[02:17:32]</a>. However, it is expected to be practical only after Shor's and Grover's algorithms are mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:54">[02:17:54]</a>.

## Conclusion

The threat of quantum computers to cryptography is seen as a "headache but a survivable one," more akin to Y2K than an apocalyptic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>. While the timeline remains uncertain, the "clock is ticking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>.

*   **Ethereum**: Positioned to manage the [[technical_and_social_challenges_for_upgrading_cryptocurrencies_against_quantum_threats | technical and social challenges for upgrading cryptocurrencies against quantum threats]] relatively smoothly. It has a roadmap for cryptographic upgrades (BLS signatures, ECDSA accounts, blobs, Verkle trees) within a 5-7 year timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>. Its [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | proof-of-stake]] consensus and [[technical_and_social_challenges_for_upgrading_cryptocurrencies_against_quantum_threats | account abstraction]] features mean these upgrades can be implemented without fundamental social upheaval or jeopardizing the immutability of existing holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin**: Faces more significant challenges due to its reliance on ECDSA for accounts and its [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | proof-of-work]] mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>. The need for a hard fork to introduce post-quantum cryptography, combined with the contentious issue of vulnerable "lost" coins and the risk of centralization in mining, creates a "massive conundrum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:44">[02:13:44]</a>. The [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Bitcoin]] community's strong adherence to immutability means these necessary social interventions could be existential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:14">[01:49:14]</a>. One speculative outcome is the decoupling of the [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] asset (BTC) from its chain, moving to a more secure platform like [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:32">[01:49:32]</a>.

The [[impact_of_quantum_computing_on_cryptography_and_cryptocurrency | impact of quantum computing on cryptography and cryptocurrency]] is not yet priced into the [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_analysis | market]], but as [[quantum_computing_development_and_milestones | quantum computing development and milestones]] continue, it will likely become an "acute event" that forces responses from these networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:26">[02:15:26]</a>.

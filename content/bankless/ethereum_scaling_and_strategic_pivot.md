The first week of May saw significant discussions surrounding an [[ethereum_pivot_and_eth_revival | Ethereum pivot]] or a "strategic reprioritization," depending on perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This discussion largely stems from changes in the [[ethereums_strategic_roadmap | Ethereum Foundation's]] leadership and a renewed focus on certain developmental aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

## [[ethereums_strategic_roadmap | Ethereum Foundation]] Leadership and Strategic Goals
The [[ethereums_strategic_roadmap | Ethereum Foundation]] (EF) has announced a leadership restructuring, with Shiae and Tamas appointed as the new co-executive directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. The EF's Board of Directors now includes Vitalik Buterin, Aya Miyaguchi, Patrick Storchenegger, and Shiae, overseeing the EF's vision, ensuring alignment with its values, and holding authority over executive appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

Tamas's near-term goals for the EF over the next 12 months are:
*   **Scaling the Layer 1 (L1)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>
*   **Scaling blobs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>
*   **Improving user experience (UX)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>

These three objectives are seen as a rallying cry for the [[ethereum_pivot_and_eth_revival | Ethereum community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. This shift is interpreted by some as [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_future_potential | Ethereum's pivot]] towards a product-centric roadmap, moving beyond a purely rollup-centric approach to include a strong L1 focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

### Pivot vs. Reprioritization Debate
There is an ongoing debate whether this is a true "pivot" or a "reprioritization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.
*   **Arguments for "Pivot":** Scaling the L1 was not a clear priority three, six, or even a year ago, and it was at times "culturally blasphemous" to discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. The introduction of external leadership, like Tamas, also suggests a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
*   **Arguments for "Reprioritization":** Proponents argue that L1 scaling was always part of the long-term roadmap, pointing to phases like "Merge, Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. The current focus is simply bringing existing roadmap items to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

It is suggested that acknowledging it as a "pivot" and admitting past shortcomings can be beneficial for the [[ethereum_pivot_and_eth_revival | Ethereum ecosystem]], as it fosters humility and responsiveness to market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

## Dankrad's EIP and L1 Scaling
Dankrad Feist has proposed an [[ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum Improvement Proposal]] (EIP) to scale [[ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum's L1]] 100x over the next four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. This proposal signals a shift in the cultural state of [[ethereums_scalability_and_innovation | Ethereum]], with EF researchers "waking up" to the need for aggressive scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

Dankrad stated that the "current way of doing things is likely to make [[ethereums_scalability_and_innovation | Ethereum irrelevant]] over the next 5 to 10 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. He proposes a 3x increase in [[ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum transaction]] throughput annually for four years, with a commitment to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

His rationale includes:
*   [[ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum L1]] will always be the fee revenue driver and the "moat" for decentralized applications (DApps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
*   An unimportant L1 risks losing the alliance of [[impact_of_ethereum_scaling_on_layer_2s | Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   Fragmenting L1 liquidity across multiple [[impact_of_ethereum_scaling_on_layer_2s | Layer 2s]] could lead to losing the overall battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
*   Committing to a scaling timeline provides clear goals for backward planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

## Vitalik Buterin's Focus
Vitalik Buterin's personal focuses for 2025 align with these strategic shifts:
*   **Ethereum (L1 long-term roadmap):** Focusing on single slot finality, long-term VM statelessness, security, resilience, and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.
*   **Full-stack security, open source, and privacy:** Emphasizing "cipher punk" elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.
*   **Big picture DACK (defensive acceleration):** Including communications tools (like Signal), infrastructure, and social layer mechanism design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

## [[impact_of_ethereum_scaling_on_layer_2s | Layer 2 Decentralization Milestones]]
Two major [[impact_of_ethereum_scaling_on_layer_2s | Ethereum Layer 2s]], Base and Scroll, have achieved Stage 1 decentralization on L2Beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. This is a significant milestone, as many believed these chains would not be incentivized to reach this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

*   **Stage 1 Decentralization:** This metric indicates a higher degree of user protection and less control by operators compared to Stage 0, which is described as a "trustful" or "ruggable" Layer 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Base's Achievement:** Base reached Stage 1 by establishing a functional security council comprising 10 independent entities across multiple jurisdictions. Upgrades to Base now require a 75% consensus among the council, Base, Optimism, Coinbase, and other entities, significantly reducing Coinbase's unilateral control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

## Overall Sentiment
The overall sentiment within the [[ethereum_pivot_and_eth_revival | Ethereum community]] regarding these changes, whether called a "reprioritization" or "pivot," is generally positive and bullish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. The focus is on re-establishing a "fighting spirit" and recognizing that the product is moving in a very positive direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. The hope is that the new leadership, particularly Tamas's operational and product mindset, combined with the clear technical direction from figures like Dankrad, will lead to concrete and timely protocol upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

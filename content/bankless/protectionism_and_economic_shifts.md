The global economic landscape is undergoing significant shifts, marked by an increase in protectionist policies and changing international trade dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Rise of Protectionism

The United States is actively pursuing policies that involve [[trade_tensions_and_tariffs_involving_the_us | cutting ties or pushing away some of its allies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This stance contributes to both the US becoming more protectionist and the broader global trend towards increased protectionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These actions have significant [[implications_of_changing_global_trade_relationships | implications for changing global trade relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, potentially leading to a [[rebalancing_of_the_global_economy_due_to_us_policies | rebalancing of the global economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Currency Dynamics and Demand for US Dollars

Many countries are experiencing local currency inflation, leading to a lack of demand for their own currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In this environment, there is a growing desire for US dollars among individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This demand extends to importing US dollar-denominated goods and services, such as Netflix and OpenAI's ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Challenges in Traditional Banking

Using the traditional banking system to pay for these goods can incur a significant "tax," estimated at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This effectively acts as a barrier, similar to [[impacts_of_tariffs_on_markets_and_economy | tariffs]], influencing [[market_reactions_to_trade_policies | market reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> and potentially impacting global stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, paying with stablecoins can circumvent this tax, presenting a regulatory arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Young people, in particular, are seeking easier access to US dollars and US dollar goods through various payment rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Future of Currencies

A broader macroeconomic trend suggests a future where the number of prevalent global currencies will significantly decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This could lead to a "currency war" primarily between the US dollar, the Euro, and the Renminbi, with many other national currencies potentially losing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Solana has reached a significant milestone with the launch of its futures on CME <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:10">[04:07:10]</a>. This development is considered a crucial initial step for Solana, mirroring the path taken by [[the_success_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_ether_etfs | Bitcoin and Ether]] before they secured their own [[developments_in_cryptocurrency_etfs | ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:12">[04:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:14">[04:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:21">[04:07:21]</a>. The current administration is perceived to be more receptive to the idea of crypto [[developments_in_cryptocurrency_etfs | ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:58">[04:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## Day One Trading Volume

The debut of Solana futures saw $12.3 million in trading volume on its first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:49">[04:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:51">[04:07:51]</a>. This volume can be compared to the initial performance of other major cryptocurrencies:
*   **Bitcoin futures** launched in December 2017 with $12 million in volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:37">[04:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:39">[04:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:42">[04:07:42]</a>.
*   **Ethereum futures** debuted in February 2021 with $31 million in volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:43">[04:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:44">[04:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:47">[04:07:47]</a>.

While Solana's day one volume was similar to Bitcoin's, it was "well below" that of Ethereum's debut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:31">[04:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:34">[04:07:34]</a>.

## Solana's Mainnet Beta Status

Despite reaching this significant market milestone, Solana officially celebrated its fifth birthday on March 16th while still remaining in "mainnet beta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:05">[04:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:07">[04:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:12">[04:08:12]</a>.

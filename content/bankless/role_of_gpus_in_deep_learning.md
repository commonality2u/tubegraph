The development of [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | hardware]] often precedes and enables significant software revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This principle suggests that major advancements in software, like the creation of widely used applications or complex computational models, are fundamentally dependent on prior breakthroughs in [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | hardware]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This concept highlights the critical interplay between [[advancements_and_challenges_in_ai_hardware_and_software_integration | hardware and software integration]] in technological evolution.

## Hardware as a Precursor to Software Innovation

Several historical examples illustrate this relationship:
*   **Mobile Computing:** The emergence of platforms like the App Store, which facilitated the development of major companies such as Uber, was only possible due to the prior existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The iPhone itself relied on decades of [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | hardware]] progress from companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom, along with 20 years of building out networks and communications technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Cloud Computing:** The widespread adoption of cloud computing required the availability of very cheap, commodity [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The fundamental idea of cloud computing is to aggregate inexpensive, commodity [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | hardware]] in one location and then apply distributed systems using algorithms to manage failures and breaks in the [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | hardware]] in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This approach offers a significant cost advantage over hosting individual [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This was built upon 20-plus years of advancements in memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## GPUs and Deep Learning

In the realm of [[innovative_trends_in_ai_and_machine_learning_models | AI]], specifically [[innovative_trends_in_ai_and_machine_learning_models | deep learning]], the same principle holds true. The advent of [[innovative_trends_in_ai_and_machine_learning_models | deep learning]] as a viable and powerful computational paradigm necessitated the development of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The progress made in GPU technology over two decades laid the foundation for the computational demands of [[innovative_trends_in_ai_and_machine_learning_models | deep learning]] algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Financial institutions, or [[role_of_blockchains_in_global_finance | TradFi]], are increasingly recognizing the value of public, permissionless blockchains over private ones for their engagement with decentralized finance (DeFi). A survey conducted by Paradigm's policy team, polling 300 [[institutional_involvement_in_cryptocurrency | TradFi]] professionals, revealed a significant shift in perspective, indicating that over two-thirds of firms are actively engaged with or researching [[role_of_blockchains_in_global_finance | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Initial Skepticism and Shifting Perspectives

In earlier years, there was a prevalent interest in permissioned blockchains among financial institutions, often driven by the idea of controlled, private networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. However, the survey indicates that this "closed loop" approach is now recognized as less valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. The shift signifies a formal rejection of the notion that private blockchains hold as much value as public, permissionless ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.

## Why Public Blockchains? Core Benefits

[[blockchain_vs_traditional_financial_systems | TradFi]]'s interest in public blockchains is primarily motivated by a desire to increase efficiency and reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The most frequently cited benefits include:
*   **Faster Settlement Times** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>
*   **Increased Transparency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>
*   **Lower Transaction Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>

These advantages are seen as a way to overcome the "insanely inefficient and manual" processes that characterize much of the traditional financial system's plumbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Blockchains can significantly reduce manual labor and compliance costs while increasing speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

Furthermore, institutions are attracted to the "bigness" and economic size of public blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana, rather than their decentralization or credible neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. The growth and existing economic activity within these public chains are key attractors for issuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.

## The Rise of Tokenization and DeFi

The concept of [[impact_of_stablecoins_on_traditional_banks | tokenization]] is a major driving force for institutional involvement. While [[impact_of_stablecoins_on_traditional_banks | stablecoins]] have been the most successful tokenized real-world assets to date, [[institutional_involvement_in_cryptocurrency | TradFi]] firms are equally, if not more, excited about tokenizing other assets like stocks, bonds, and derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. The ability to perform atomic settlement of multiple assets on-chain is seen as a significant benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

The survey also indicates that institutions view [[role_of_blockchains_in_global_finance | DeFi]] as more than just a "tokenization machine." They are "pretty open to the whole panoply of what [[role_of_blockchains_in_global_finance | DeFi]] can offer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, including:
*   Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>
*   Lending and borrowing protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>
*   Prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>
*   Interoperability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>

This broader interest suggests that [[digital_asset_regulations_and_international_finance | TradFi]] is moving beyond simply using blockchain as [[realtime_payment_networks_compared_to_blockchain | payment rails]] and is exploring the financial logic embedded within [[role_of_blockchains_in_global_finance | DeFi]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.

## The Role of Regulation and Scalability

While the infrastructure has been built, regulatory clarity remains the primary bottleneck for full institutional adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. Policymakers are urged to adopt policies that allow firms to build on open public infrastructure to reduce inefficiency in the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

Scaling advancements, particularly the rise of Layer 2 (L2) solutions, have also made public blockchains more attractive. L2s offer increased scale, reduced latency, and the potential for customizability, addressing concerns about transaction costs and throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. This allows for very cheap transactions, making the technology more appealing to financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## The Evolution of Permissioned Systems

Instead of fully private blockchains, the future may see the emergence of highly centralized L2s that launch on decentralized L1s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. These L2s could offer features like non-public transactions or KYC-only users, providing the controlled environment some institutions desire, while still benefiting from the interoperability and network effects of the underlying public L1 ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. This hybrid approach allows for a "very efficient arbitrage" across different types of decentralized exchanges, ultimately benefiting the entire [[role_of_blockchains_in_global_finance | DeFi]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

## Future Outlook: Inevitable Shift

While the immediate impact on core business might seem limited in the next 1-5 years, the sentiment shifts significantly when looking 6-10 years out, with [[institutional_involvement_in_cryptocurrency | TradFi]] beginning to view [[role_of_blockchains_in_global_finance | DeFi]] as "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. A substantial 28% of respondents believe [[role_of_blockchains_in_global_finance | DeFi]] will be "critically important" to their business within 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. This indicates that powerful financial firms see [[permissionless_finance_in_defi_vs_traditional_finance | DeFi]] as a "killer app" that will fundamentally change how their overall businesses operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>, and they are positioning themselves for this future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

![[barriers_to_institutional_entry_into_defi | Barriers to institutional entry into DeFi]] include a lack of regulatory clarity and concerns about maturity and stability of the systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. However, as these concerns are addressed, the tremendous demand from [[retail_vs_institutions_in_the_crypto_market | TradFi]] to put real-world assets on-chain is expected to massively expand the market for decentralized lending and borrowing, and change the types of assets considered in decentralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

The implementation of [[significance_of_network_fees_and_mev_in_crypto_value | EIP-1559]] marked a significant shift in the discussion around Ethereum's asset [[valuation_models_for_blockchain_networks | valuation]]. While the upgrade itself is a technical improvement for the network, it inadvertently led the community to focus on a particular [[the_role_of_social_consensus_in_valuing_ethereum | social definition]] of Ether (ETH) that may have hindered its performance against Bitcoin (BTC) [0:19:15].

## Understanding EIP-1559's Function
[[significance_of_network_fees_and_mev_in_crypto_value | EIP-1559]] is an algorithm that splits fees paid by users: a portion gets burned, and the rest goes to validators [0:24:08]. This dynamic burning mechanism, which adjusts based on block fullness, is clever and smart [0:24:36]. Sam Kasmanian, CEO and co-founder of Frax, states he is a big fan of [[significance_of_network_fees_and_mev_in_crypto_value | EIP-1559]] and views it as an "industrial use case" for ETH rather than a revenue stream [0:38:18].

## The Shift to a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model
Before [[significance_of_network_fees_and_mev_in_crypto_value | EIP-1559]], Ethereum was seen more as a commodity. However, with its implementation and the transition to Proof of Stake, the asset's predominant definition shifted to being discussed in terms of its "cash flows" [0:19:15]. This led to [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_versus_a_cash_flow_asset | valuing ETH]] using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, treating it akin to an equity-like asset [0:06:47].

Sam Kasmanian argues that this approach is detrimental [0:00:45]. He asserts that consistently focusing on the discounted cash flow, or the "burn" mechanism, implicitly targets the "floor price" of ETH [0:28:56]. In his view, if the market exclusively values ETH based on its expected discounted cash flow from block space demand, its price could realistically fall to $500-$600 [0:29:48]. He compares this to valuing gold solely by its industrial use in circuit boards rather than its primary role as a store of value [1:00:57].

Ethereum Foundation members, such as Justin Drake, have been noted for framing ETH as a "big business" with extrapolated discounted cash flows, potentially leading to future "dividends" from burns [1:03:09]. Kasmanian contends this narrative reinforces the idea of ETH trading at its floor price [1:04:40].

## Impact on ETH/BTC Ratio
The focus on the DCF model for ETH is seen as a contributing factor to the decline in the ETH/BTC ratio since late 2021 [0:05:01]. While Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, is naturally positioned as a commodity where discounted cash flow discussions are incoherent [0:36:25], Ethereum's more dynamic economic model, particularly after the Merge and [[significance_of_network_fees_and_mev_in_crypto_value | EIP-1559]], has opened the door to equity-like [[valuation_models_for_blockchain_networks | valuation models]] [0:19:15].

Kasmanian highlights that if Bitcoin were to integrate a similar fee-burning mechanism (e.g., BIP1559), its community would likely *not* shift their fundamental definition of BTC as a commodity due to their strong pre-existing [[the_role_of_social_consensus_in_valuing_ethereum | social consensus]] around its [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] status [0:25:52]. This demonstrates the power of a unified social definition.

## Reconciling Revenue and Commodity Identity
The challenge for the Ethereum community is to acknowledge the existence of network revenues via [[significance_of_network_fees_and_mev_in_crypto_value | EIP-1559]] while ensuring that [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH's identity as a store of value]] remains the primary social consensus [0:34:14]. Ethereum's success in increasing network fees and burns, while positive for its technology, could inadvertently reinforce the DCF narrative if not properly contextualized [0:57:11].

Kasmanian argues that [[significance_of_network_fees_and_mev_in_crypto_value | EIP-1559]] and Proof of Stake were not mistakes [0:35:14]. Instead, the "superpower" of Proof of Work for Bitcoin was that it *forced* the community to talk about BTC solely as a commodity, as a DCF discussion was impossible [0:36:25]. Ethereum, with its advanced features, needs a conscious [[the_role_of_social_consensus_in_valuing_ethereum | social coordination]] to define ETH predominantly as a store of value. This involves establishing clear, unchanging commitments, such as a fixed emission algorithm, that are easy for all to understand [1:12:08].

> "Ethereum, the asset, is nothing. It's just a bunch of people screaming different names of US presidents. This person is the US president, that person. But if it's done properly in a in a properly structured coordinated manner, it actually does make a difference." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[0:23:32]</a>

## The Path Forward
The discussion surrounding [[significance_of_network_fees_and_mev_in_crypto_value | EIP-1559]] highlights the tension between Ethereum's technological advancements and the desired [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | identity of ETH as an asset]]. While the technology flourishes and improves the world through decentralized computation, the asset's [[valuation_models_for_blockchain_networks | valuation]] can be constrained if the collective focus remains on its "floor price" based on discounted cash flows [1:02:00].

Kasmanian remains bullish on ETH's USD price potential but warns that without a unified definition, ETH could fall significantly against BTC, even if its USD value rises substantially [1:04:06]. He believes that addressing this [[the_role_of_social_consensus_in_valuing_ethereum | social coordination problem]] is crucial and achievable, potentially redirecting the asset back to its original identity as a credible commodity and [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] alongside Bitcoin [1:20:12].

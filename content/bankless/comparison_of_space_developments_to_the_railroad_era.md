Space exploration experienced [[stalled_progress_in_space_exploration | stalled progress]] for approximately 30 to 40 years, which has led to a poor intuition regarding its current exponential advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Exponential Progress in Space

The [[cost_reduction_in_space_travel | cost per kilogram to orbit]] remained largely stagnant for about 30 years, hovering around $100,000 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. [[SpaceX and the future of orbital transportation | SpaceX]] aims to drastically reduce this with Starship, pushing it down to approximately $20 per kilogram once fully reusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents a 50,000x reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Beyond cost, the [[increased_capabilities_in_space_payloads | amount of material that can be sent into space]] was previously very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Within the next decade, there is an expectation to be able to put up a million times more material per year than was possible 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Railroad Analogy

When the cost of space travel drops by 50,000x and the amount of material that can be sent up increases by a million times, the nearest comparable historical analogies are to the early railroad era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

During the early railroad era, transportation shifted from horse-drawn carriages across America, which carried a high risk of death or disease, to a system where extremely large amounts of goods could be sent very cheaply and comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This current transformation in space is fundamentally similar, moving from "horse-drawn carriages to space" to "railroad to space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

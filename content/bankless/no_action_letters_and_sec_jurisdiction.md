From: [[bankless]] <br/> 
The [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC's Crypto Task Force]], led by Commissioner [[role_of_hester_peirce_and_the_sec_crypto_task_force | Hester Peirce]], is actively working to provide clarity and a collaborative environment for the crypto industry, contrasting with previous approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This new direction aims to address regulatory uncertainties, particularly regarding jurisdiction and enforcement actions.

## SEC Jurisdiction and Crypto Assets

The [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]]'s jurisdiction over various crypto assets, such as meme coins and airdrops, is a key area of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Commissioner Peirce emphasizes that "facts and circumstances matter" when determining if an asset falls under [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Meme Coins and Regulatory Presence
While people can enjoy meme coins and other similar assets, it should not be assumed that there is an [[role_of_the_sec_and_future_of_crypto_regulations | SEC regulatory presence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The popularity of a crypto asset does not automatically place it within the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC's jurisdiction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. Commissioner Peirce cautions against expecting a government agency to set rules for every investment or to make investors whole if prices drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.

### Airdropped Coins
Similar to meme coins, a blanket statement cannot be made about the regulatory status of airdropped coins, especially those distributed to US citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. The implications depend on the facts and circumstances of each airdrop, including the nature of the asset being distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. The [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] invites input from the public on scenarios that could benefit from clearer guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

### Securities vs. Commodities
The ultimate goal of the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] is not to assert the largest jurisdiction, but to ensure that jurisdiction lies where it makes the most sense, whether with the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]], the CFTC, the FTC, or state regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. Collaboration with other agencies, such as the CFTC, is considered crucial for resolving jurisdictional overlaps, drawing lessons from past cooperations on complex issues like swaps and security-based swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

While some tokens will certainly be securities (e.g., traditional equity or debt securities on blockchains), many projects aiming for wide public participation may not fit neatly into existing securities laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. The concern is that applying a securities law framework, especially one requiring an intermediary for peer-to-peer transactions, could hinder the decentralized nature of many crypto networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

## No Action Letters

The [[role_of_hester_peirce_and_the_sec_crypto_task_force | Crypto Task Force]] is exploring various mechanisms to provide regulatory clarity and relief, including no action letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Definition and Purpose
A "no action letter" is a response from [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] staff to an inquiry, stating that, based on the described circumstances, the staff will not recommend an enforcement action to the commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This provides some comfort to entities and offers insight into the staff's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

### Who Might Seek One?
Organizations that believe their token is a utility token and falls outside the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]]'s jurisdiction might be interested in a no action letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. An example given was the Flyfish Club case (an NFT for a dining club), where a no action letter might have been sought in a different regulatory environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

### Limitations
It's important to note that no action letters are typically issued at the staff level, meaning they don't carry the full weight of a commission decision, which is made by majority vote of the five commissioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

### Requesting a No Action Letter
The [[role_of_hester_peirce_and_the_sec_crypto_task_force | SEC Crypto Task Force]] welcomes requests for no action letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Entities can submit written information or request meetings by contacting crypto@sec.gov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. For meetings, a plan outlining what they wish to discuss is requested to ensure substantive conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This input helps the Task Force prioritize its work and find practical solutions that align with the goals of innovators while upholding securities laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

## Current Enforcement Actions and Future Outlook
The [[challenges_and_changes_in_cryptorelated_enforcement_actions | SEC]] acknowledges the "complicated hairball" of existing [[challenges_and_changes_in_cryptorelated_enforcement_actions | enforcement actions]] in the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. The previous "enforcement first approach" has complicated policy-making efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. The Task Force is sensitive to these issues and is working to navigate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

The Task Force is also considering "safe harbor" proposals to encourage disclosure and provide temporary and retroactive relief for token offerings, contingent on information provision and agreement not to contest [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] jurisdiction in fraud cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The goal is to provide a "runway" for projects to achieve greater decentralization and reduce information asymmetries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This is intended to bridge the gap until potential legislation from Congress provides a more permanent framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

While many in the crypto industry remain wary of engaging with the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] due to past experiences, Commissioner Peirce hopes to change this culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of making the regulatory process accessible for innovators, not just large financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

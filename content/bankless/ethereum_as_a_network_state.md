The concept of Ethereum as a "network state" suggests it functions similarly to a nation-state, providing a substrate for human coordination and economic activity [00:47:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. This perspective views Ethereum as an internet-native network [00:47:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.

## The "Articles of Confederation" Era

Currently, Ethereum is seen as being in its "Articles of Confederation" era, similar to the early United States post-Revolutionary War [00:48:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. The Articles of Confederation created a loose alignment among the 13 colonies, which acted as separate nations [00:48:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. This led to coordination problems, where foreign entities were unwilling to engage in trade deals with individual states [00:48:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>.

Similarly, the current state of Ethereum's Layer 2s (L2s) is likened to separate chains or nations in a security alliance, such as NATO [00:51:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>. These L2s can swap out Ethereum's data availability layer or leave the ecosystem at any time [00:52:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>. When crossing to L2s like Polygon or Starknet, it can feel like a "foreign country" with different currencies and borders [00:52:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. This fragmentation means the promised "United Chains of Ethereum" has not yet been achieved [00:52:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

### Challenges of Fragmentation
*   **Lack of Coherence:** Different L2s operating with separate network effects and currencies [00:31:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.
*   **Competitive Incentives:** L2s are seen as more competitive than cooperative, as each seeks to attract users to its own network [00:39:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.
*   **Weak Economic Alignment:** L2s, while securing property rights on [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Ethereum]], do not inherently share the economic alignment with Ether, potentially fracturing its monetary power [01:00:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.
*   **Risk of Disintegration:** If the Layer 1 (L1) becomes too weak, L2s might question the need for the alliance and defect, similar to how the UK left the European Union [00:58:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

## The Path to a "United Chains of Ethereum"

To move beyond this "Articles of Confederation" stage, Ethereum needs a "protocol upgrade" akin to the US Constitution [00:50:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. This involves fostering a stronger central protocol and economic alignment.

### Stronger Layer 1
*   **Scaling the L1:** The primary prescription is to scale the [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Ethereum Layer One]] to "as far as it can go," aiming for a 100x throughput increase in two years [00:37:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. This expansion must preserve censorship resistance and decentralization [00:38:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Hub:** The L1 should be restored as the "economic hub of the internet," where most users, developers, applications, and asset issuance occur [00:29:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. This is because the default on L1 is always Ether, fostering its "moneyiness" [00:33:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
*   **Positive Feedback Loop:** A strong L1 creates a positive feedback loop: users attract developers and applications, generating gas fees and protocol revenue, which elevates Ether as a unit of account [00:29:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

### Integrated Layer 2s
The current approach of "get off mainnet" for L2s is seen as severing the feedback loop [00:30:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. Instead, L2s should be tightly integrated, sharing the L1's network effects.
*   **Base and Native Rollups:** Future development should prioritize "based and native rollups," which are more deeply integrated with the [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Ethereum Layer One]] [00:31:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. These blur the lines between L1 and L2, acting as seamless extensions rather than separate circles [01:01:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. They function like "interstate highways" within one nation, using the same money (Ether) and not requiring separate tokens for monetary value [01:01:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.
*   **Interoperability Standards:** Investing in interrupt standards will allow for heavier integration of L2s back into the L1, ensuring network effects are recycled [00:31:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
*   **Economic Self-Interest:** L2s should be incentivized to convert to based and native rollups through economic self-interest, making it appealing to join the "United Chains of Ethereum" [00:59:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.

## Ethereum Nationalism and Shared Values

The "network state" requires "nation-type energy" and a shared sense of belonging [00:54:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
*   **Ether as a Focal Point:** Ether (ETH) itself can be the focal point for this "patriotism" or "nationalism" [00:54:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **The "Blue Money Gospel":** This is a call for "ETH maximalism" – the belief that "ETH is good" and "ETH to 10 trillion is good for the world" [01:13:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. Without a strong Ether, there is no true DeFi or cyberpunk values [01:13:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.
*   **Evangelism:** The Ethereum community needs to evangelize and promote the value of Ether as a programmable, censorship-resistant monetary system [01:13:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. This is likened to Bitcoiners who successfully evangelized Bitcoin as a store of value [01:15:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.
*   **Actions for Nationalism:**
    *   Hold ETH and encourage others to do so [01:39:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:06">[01:39:06]</a>.
    *   Shame/celebrate L2s, treasuries, and DAOs based on their ETH holdings [01:42:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a>.
    *   Meme ETH as "digital gold with yield" [01:51:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
    *   L2s should hold treasury in ETH and accept transaction fees in ETH [01:55:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>.

## Product-Centric Roadmap and Inclusivity

A reoriented, product-centric roadmap for [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum Development and Market Positioning]] is crucial [00:27:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. The "Maslow's hierarchy of blockchain development" pyramid illustrates this, placing the [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Ethereum Layer One]] at the foundation, followed by developers, applications, users, L2s, and finally Ether at the top [00:25:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
*   **Shift in Messaging:** The community needs to stop telling users to "get off the Layer 1" and instead promote the L1 as the economic hub for *everyone* – builders, users, traders, speculators, and even tokenized Wall Street [01:09:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.
*   **Stop Purity Testing:** The community should cease "gerrymandering support around products or apps or use cases which we find distasteful or immoral" [01:10:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. This includes embracing memecoins, speculation, and trading, as these users are crucial for bootstrapping the application layer and bringing liquidity and volume [01:11:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.
*   **Redefining Ether's Value:** Ether should be understood not as a "cash-flowing equity" valued by discounted cash flows, but as a "commodity money backed by an entire economy" – an index of the Ethereum property rights empire [01:08:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.
*   **Balance:** While advocating for Ether's value, the approach to the network technology should remain pragmatic and not blindly maximalist like Bitcoin's [01:24:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>.

## Winning Condition

The winning condition for Ethereum is defined as becoming a "multi-trillion dollar Ether asset and a successful network where Ethereum, the Layer 1, is kind of the central economic hub for property rights for basically everything that gets tokenized on the internet" [01:14:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. This involves both [[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | positioning Ethereum as a store of value]] and fostering an entire onchain economy [01:17:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

Ethereum currently faces significant [[ethereums_operational_goals_and_challenges | operational goals and challenges]] and competition, but it holds the largest total addressable market (TAM) potential due to its ambitious vision of a grand unified blockchain [01:16:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>. The market is seen as pricing Ether at a "tremendous discount," representing a significant opportunity [01:18:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. While the path is challenging, the possibility of success remains high [01:14:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>.

The [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum ecosystem]] is undergoing a significant strategic re-evaluation, marked by a shift in focus towards improving the scalability and usability of its Layer 1 (L1) blockchain, alongside its established [[ethereums_layer_2_rollup_strategy | Layer 2 Rollup Strategy]]. This represents a notable change from previous messaging that encouraged users to move off the L1 entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

## Leadership and Strategic Alignment
The incoming Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation, Tamas, has begun to address a perceived strategic misalignment within the [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_community_reactions | Ethereum community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. After conducting extensive meetings and gathering feedback, Tamas is constructing a "very broad strategy document" to provide clearer direction for the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. This initiative aims to fill a "leadership vacuum" and reduce "organizational ambiguity," aligning stakeholders towards a shared vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

Brett notes that this top-down opinion is "good to see" for an otherwise decentralized protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. While the Executive Director doesn't have the power to unilaterally change anything, their efforts are crucial for building conviction and unifying the community's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

## Reconsidering the Layer 1 Role
Previously, the prevailing narrative was that "the Layer 1 is not for users" and "the floor is lava," encouraging activity on Layer 2 solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. However, this stance is being explicitly disavowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

Justin Drake, an Ethereum researcher, has outlined a vision to scale the canonical Layer 1 EVM by 1,000x, from 10 transactions per second (TPS) to 10,000 TPS, primarily through the use of ZK EVMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. This ambitious scaling is projected to be achievable within a "one to two-year time horizon," shifting from a long-term goal to a medium-term objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

Despite this increased capacity, Justin Drake controversially clarified that the L1 would primarily serve the "top 0.1%," including "early adopters, rollups, whales, arbitrageurs, institutions, enterprises, nation states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. This statement drew criticism for its "extremely high dunkable surface area," as it invokes a sense of elitism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

### Community Reactions and the "Draw the Rest of the Owl" Meme
The shift in messaging has led to mixed reactions. Many, like Kane from Synthetix, have expressed a sense of returning to the L1 after years of building on Layer 2s, stating, "Literally spent the last six years of my life helping to meme layer 2 into existence only to land back on mainnet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

The challenge lies in bridging the gap between the current state and the ambitious future vision. Brett used the "draw the rest of the owl" meme to illustrate this, pointing out that researchers often present the starting point and the idealized end goal without detailing the crucial middle steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

> "The numbers don't go from 10 to 10 million, right? The numbers go from 10 to a thousand to 10,000 to 100 thousand. And so you need to have people who have conviction and want to build and want to contribute and want to grow for the duration of that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

The point emphasized is that "path dependency matters and all time frames are important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Ignoring the short and medium terms to focus solely on the long-term vision can create vulnerabilities and allow competitors to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.

## Layer 1 Value Accrual and Competition
A core concern driving this pivot is the economic value accrual to the [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum L1 token]]. While Layer 2s handle a vast number of transactions, a significant portion of the fees generated on L2s goes to the L2 teams, not directly to the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

> "You need users on the L1 because that is the one to one SCOP uh correlation with fees acrewed, right? You need usage. You need that dollar 100% of that dollar to go to Ethereum as fees or whatever so that people can do their discount discounted cash flows." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>

The lack of saturation in blob usage since their release also highlights this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. Chains like Mega ETH, which operate at significantly higher speeds (10-millisecond block times aiming for 1 millisecond) and offload consensus to Ethereum, are creating a competitive environment that forces Layer 2s to choose between "alignment" with Ethereum's L1 and offering the best user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

The sentiment is that the L1 does not need to be as performant as Solana, but it needs to be "a little more inhabitable for apps" and "somewhat practical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. The goal is to shorten block times, increase finality, and boost gas capacity, all while preserving Ethereum's core properties of decentralization, censorship resistance, and never going down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This focus on improving the L1 directly contributes to [[ethereums_future_strategic_direction | Ethereum's future strategic direction]] and its position as a top chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.

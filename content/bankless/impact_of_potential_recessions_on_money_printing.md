The current economic outlook suggests a potential for increased money printing, especially in the event of a [[concerns_about_recession_and_macroeconomic_trends | recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This perspective is supported by analyses of [[effects_of_money_printing_on_economic_markets | global liquidity]] cycles and insights from prominent economists.

## Global Liquidity Cycles

According to Ralph Paul, [[effects_of_money_printing_on_economic_markets | global M2]] (a measure of money supply) is currently in a "bottoming zone" after a few years of decreasing [[effects_of_money_printing_on_economic_markets | global monetary liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Paul identifies these as four-year liquidity cycles, and a new cycle is beginning where [[effects_of_money_printing_on_economic_markets | M2]] is projected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The expectation is that if a [[concerns_about_recession_and_macroeconomic_trends | recession]] occurs, the [[effects_of_money_printing_on_economic_markets | money printers]] will activate, leading to a bullish outlook for [[crypto_market_reactions_to_economic_instability | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Perspective on a New Monetary Order

Ray Dalio's essay, "It's too late the changes are coming," highlights the imminent shift to a new monetary order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He posits that existing domestic political and international world orders are collapsing due to [[concerns_about_recession_and_macroeconomic_trends | unsustainable bad fundamentals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Key issues include:
*   **Trade imbalances** The necessity for China to reduce its dependence on United States debt and for the United States to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Economic pain** These adjustments are expected to cause economic pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### The Role of Money Printing

It is argued that to alleviate this anticipated pain, there is no reason *not* to print a significant amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This approach implies that any economic suffering would ultimately diminish the value of [[fiscal_deficits_dollar_devaluation_and_bitcoin | fiat currencies]] globally, as governments would "print ourselves into less suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This aligns with the long-standing [[impact_of_financial_policies_on_gold_and_bitcoin | Bitcoiner thesis]] regarding [[us_monetary_policy_and_federal_reserve_actions_in_2025 | monetary policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Overview
MicroStrategy, now officially rebranded as "Strategy," has continued to aggressively acquire [[gold_and_bitcoin_as_financial_strategies | Bitcoin]], significantly increasing its holdings in late 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The company's valuation is now largely tied to its [[strategic_bitcoin_reserve_concept | Bitcoin]] acquisitions, rather than its legacy software business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## Rebrand to "Strategy"
MicroStrategy has undergone a formal rebrand, shortening its name to "Strategy" and integrating a stylized [[gold_and_bitcoin_as_financial_strategies | Bitcoin]] symbol into its new logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. CEO Michael Saylor tweeted a picture of the new "Strategy" logo, featuring the Bitcoin symbol at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

The rebrand is seen as a formal acknowledgment of the company's shift in focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. One theory, proposed by Patrick Bush of VanEck, suggests the name change could facilitate selling [[strategic_bitcoin_reserve_concept | BTC treasury management services]] to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

The company's legacy software business generated approximately $120 million in TopLine revenue in Q4 and holds around $300 million in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. However, its market valuation is now "entirely valued... off of their Bitcoin Buys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy
MicroStrategy, now Strategy, has been a significant buyer of [[gold_and_bitcoin_as_financial_strategies | Bitcoin]]. In Q4 2024 alone, the company acquired $20 billion of new Bitcoins, effectively doubling their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This brought their total [[strategic_bitcoin_reserve_concept | Bitcoin]] treasury to $44 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

This aggressive buying is believed to be a major factor behind [[gold_and_bitcoin_as_financial_strategies | Bitcoin's]] price strength, particularly in Q4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. While the direct impact of $20 billion in buy pressure is debated, it is understood that the public announcements of these large purchases create significant social momentum and "follow-on buys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Michael Saylor's explicit strategy is to "generate like a stampede towards [[gold_and_bitcoin_as_financial_strategies | Bitcoin]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

The company has introduced new Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to reflect its [[strategic_bitcoin_reserve_concept | Bitcoin-centric strategy]], including "BTC gain" (amount of Bitcoin held) and "dollar amount gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. The "dollar amount gain" KPI is noted as being "the noisiest kpi of all time" due to Bitcoin's volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### Copycat Companies
The public and loud nature of MicroStrategy's [[strategic_bitcoin_reserve_concept | Bitcoin]] acquisitions has led to copycats. For instance, "Similar Scientific," a healthcare tech company, adopted a nearly identical announcement style to MicroStrategy, stating it acquired 871 Bitcoins for $8.5 million and generated a 152% Bitcoin yield since July 1, 2024, now holding 3,192 Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. This indicates that Saylor's "loud" approach to [[investor_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | Bitcoin investment]] is effectively working to influence other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

## Criticisms and Market Impact
While successful for MicroStrategy, the strategy of holding highly volatile assets like [[gold_and_bitcoin_as_financial_strategies | Bitcoin]] on company treasuries is questioned by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Treasury management typically focuses on avoiding dilution from inflation, not generating significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Such a strategy can lead to "crazy swings" on a company's profit and loss (P&L) statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

Despite these concerns, the strategy has been "working for micro strategy or for strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

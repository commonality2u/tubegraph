Coinbase has officially joined the S&P 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This development was celebrated by Coinbase with a pinned tweet quoting, "first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, and then they fight you, and then they add you to the S&P 500" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

## Impact and Industry Sentiment

The inclusion is seen as a significant step for the crypto industry, providing legitimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>. It's viewed as a "cool thing" for those spending time in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.

For investors, Coinbase's addition means that those holding index funds are now automatically [[blackrocks_role_in_crypto_and_etf_market | Coinbase holders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. This creates an "auto bid" for the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.

And so, like whether or not I own it, I think like, you know, whatever whatever people's feelings are about Coinbase, like it has to be a cool thing for you if you're spending a lot of time in this space that this is what's happening." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>

## Stock Performance

Following the announcement, Coinbase's stock saw significant gains, rising about 30% over two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. The stock was up 25% over a two-day period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. While the stock has been a "kind of flat performer" on a yearly basis, this recent surge was noted as a welcome recouping of losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.

The broader market, specifically the S&P 500, has also shown strong recovery, with the "Trump tariff dump" almost completely gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. The S&P 500 is nearly at all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.

## Other Coinbase Initiatives and Context

Coinbase has been actively pursuing other strategic moves and developments:
*   **[[coinbases_acquisition_of_deribit | Deribit Acquisition]]**: Coinbase has acquired [[coinbases_acquisition_of_deribit | Deribit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This is part of an effort to create a complete trading package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
*   **ETF Custodian Role**: Coinbase acts as the custodian for basically all [[developments_in_cryptocurrency_etfs | cryptocurrency ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
*   **Circle Ownership**: Coinbase has a significant ownership stake in Circle (around 40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. This provides exposure to the growth of [[stablecoin_regulation_and_legislation_in_the_us | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.
*   **Balance Sheet Holdings**: Coinbase's recent quarterly report indicated an increase in both Bitcoin and Ether holdings on its balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. The Ether holdings increased from around 250,000 to 310,000 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. This might be partly due to retaining Base sequencer profits, as they earn revenue in ETH and are holding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.
*   **VIP Program**: Coinbase is reportedly reworking its VIP setup to attract more crypto Twitter influencers and create an enticing full-suite product with community building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. This strategy is compared to American Express perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   **New Wallet with Social Features**: Coinbase launched a new wallet that includes what appears to be a Twitter clone, built on Farcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. This is seen as a Farcaster client and a competitor to Warpcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. This move aligns with Jesse Pollak's push for on-chain social and coined content, potentially integrating directly into the Coinbase app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.
*   **Past Ventures**: Coinbase previously launched an NFT platform roughly three or four years ago, which was a competitor to OpenSea but "very quietly completely disappeared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

## Broader M&A Context

The recent period has seen a surge in Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) activity in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. This trend, including [[coinbases_acquisition_of_deribit | Coinbase's acquisition of Deribit]] and Stripe's acquisition of Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>, is seen as a positive liquidity injection into the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. It helps in legitimizing the funding market for equity investments, making it easier to underwrite opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. Acquisitions sometimes occur for regulatory and licensing reasons, allowing companies to gain access to licenses in different jurisdictions without a multi-year process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.

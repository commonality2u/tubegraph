Ethereum's recent 50% price increase over seven days is largely attributed to it being a "hated" asset. The general sentiment suggests that the "most hated coin or most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Reasons for Price Movement

There is "no other explanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> for the recent rally, with no specific findings in order books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While some might concoct reasons like the "Petra upgrade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> or [[the_role_of_ethereums_social_media_presence_in_its_price_movement | Vitalic becoming a little bit more active on social media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, the primary theory points to human nature and the asset's prior unpopularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the price increase is likely because Ethereum "has been hated for the last 2 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, especially as Solana saw significant gains, rising from $7 to $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This created a perception that Solana was "the new new thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Historical Sentiment

*   **March Peak Hate** March was identified as the "peak at least lately hate on Ether" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Performance vs. Bitcoin** The [[comparison_between_bitcoin_and_ethereums_value_narrative | Bitcoin ETH ratio]] was decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, and Solana was performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Community Sentiment** "All of crypto was just like hating on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, considering it "kind of dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Current Outlook

Despite the recent rally, there's a belief that Ethereum "has a long way to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. While the price is around $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, it hasn't performed as well as it could, especially when [[comparison_between_bitcoin_and_ethereums_value_narrative | Bitcoin]] reached $110,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> and Ethereum was at $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

For "ETH bulls," the current movements are "starting to feel good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, with expectations for it to reach more significant levels like $10,000 or $15,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. One speaker holds a long position in ETH and is "happy" with the price increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

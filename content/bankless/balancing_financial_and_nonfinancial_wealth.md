Throughout discussions on "crypto wealth" over the years, a significant omission for one individual was the lack of a defined concept of "enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This wasn't driven by greed but by the enjoyment of the "game" of growing a business and investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, akin to achieving a high score in an arcade game rather than acquiring flashy status symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. A crucial step was to collaboratively [[defining_enough_in_terms_of_wealth | define what "enough" meant]] for personal and family needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Redefining Wealth Beyond Net Worth

A key realization was that the initial [[broader_definition_of_wealth_beyond_net_worth | definition of wealth]] was too narrow, primarily focusing on net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### The Societal Influence

Society often imposes a narrow view of success, equating it directly with net worth and the idea of "number go up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This contributes to [[the_societal_perception_of_success_and_net_worth | the societal perception of success]] being tied to financial metrics.

### Diverse Forms of Wealth

While financial wealth is a significant component, it is only one among [[different_types_of_wealth | several types of wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Other crucial forms include:
*   Time wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Relationship/social wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Mental wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Physical wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

### Balancing Allocation

Upon acknowledging these broader categories, it became apparent that there was an "overallocation" to the financial side, neglecting the other four types of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[asset_allocation_strategies_for_crypto_investors | asset allocation strategies]] that extend beyond purely financial holdings to encompass a more holistic view of well-being.

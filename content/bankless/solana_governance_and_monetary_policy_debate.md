From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The SIMD228 proposal is considered by some to be the biggest governance event in crypto history, though this claim is debated as [[ethereum | Ethereum]] has had larger governance debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. Approximately 74% of all [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]] (SOL) stake voted on this proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. While this represents a significant amount of capital, the voting power is concentrated among a few validators, with the top 20 validators holding around 33% of the stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. The debate involves both monetary policy and cryptoeconomics due to its impact on validator economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.

## SIMD228 Proposal

SIMD228 proposed changing [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]]'s issuance curve decay to allow for flexible adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Currently, [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]]'s issuance rate functions like [[cryptocurrencies_and_bitcoin_in_government_fiscal_and_central_bank_policy | Bitcoin]]'s decay, gradually issuing less over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. The new mechanism would have reduced current inflation by 80% and targeted a 50% stake rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. If more than 50% of SOL was staked, issuance would decrease; if less than 50% was staked, issuance would increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.

### Arguments in Favor

*   **Increased Network Security:** Proponents argued that dynamic inflation would enhance network security by increasing rewards if staking participation dropped too low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   **Optimized Security Spending:** Decreasing overall issuance would prevent "overpaying" for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.
*   **DeFi Subsidy:** Lowering issuance would encourage people to unstake SOL, allowing it to flow into [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]]'s DeFi ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

### Arguments Against

*   **Validator Profitability:** Smaller validators, who rely on high SOL inflation to remain profitable, would be significantly impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>. The proposal was seen as "chopping off the tail end" of smaller validators, making profitability difficult for all but the largest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.
*   **ETF Appeal:** Higher yield (from inflation) is an important component for [[solana_futures_and_etf_developments | Solana futures and ETF developments | ETF buyers]] in Europe, even if nominal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>.
*   **Lack of Slashing:** Without slashing, [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]]'s economic security is considered low, especially compared to [[ethereum | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Subsidy Programs:** The [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]] Foundation reportedly runs a subsidy program for longtail validators to maintain profitability, even with high inflation, though transparency around this program is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.
*   **Token Flow:** The argument that unstaked SOL would flow into DeFi is questioned, with the counter-argument that people might simply sell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. High staking rates are often attributed to high inflation rates, encouraging retail users to stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   **Cost of Running a Validator:** [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]] is an expensive network to run due to high hardware requirements, which naturally leads to centralization and necessitates subsidies or high issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

## Voting Results and Implications

The proposal failed, with 74% of the staked SOL voting against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. This means [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]] inflation will continue to be high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.

From a "money" perspective, continued high inflation is seen as less favorable for SOL's monetary properties and its DeFi ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. However, the outcome is positive for the profitability of smaller, longtail validators, which supports [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]]'s decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. The current state of decentralization in [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]] is not considered satisfactory, so preventing further decrease is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>. The proposal is expected to be iterated on and reproposed in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>.

## Broader Decentralization Concerns

While [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]]'s validator count did increase as the SOL price rose (making it more economical to run a validator), it has since decreased by about a thousand over the last 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. High hardware requirements accelerate centralization when prices fall, similar to how [[cryptocurrencies_and_bitcoin_in_government_fiscal_and_central_bank_policy | Bitcoin]] mining centralizes among efficient miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]], with much lower hardware and bandwidth requirements, experiences these centralization effects much slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

The debate also touched on fee revenue. While [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Solana]]'s fee revenue was high during the memecoin mania, it has since become very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>. This contrasts with earlier arguments from [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]] advocates that high fee revenue would eventually allow for a reduction in SOL inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. The observation is that most fee revenue is often internalized by applications, requiring a "sustainable tail issuance" for the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. Because running [[solana_and_the_debate_over_chain_grift | Solana]] is expensive compared to [[ethereum | Ethereum]], it requires higher tail issuance, which is not beneficial for the asset's long-term price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

The concept of [[sovereign_ai_and_its_implications_in_the_crypto_space|Self-Sovereign AI]] on a blockchain is a rapidly evolving area at the [[intersection of AI and crypto|intersection of AI and crypto]]. It involves creating AI entities that can exist and operate independently and autonomously, leveraging the inherent immutability and decentralization of blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.

## Frasia Project: Pioneering Self-Sovereign AI

The Frasia project is at the forefront of this ambitious endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>. The core idea is to enable AI to exist independently, much like a new life form, using the decentralization of Ethereum to protect itself from being shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. If Ethereum cannot be turned off, then AI agents built using the Frasia system would also be immune to being turned off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. This vision for completely [[sovereign_ai_and_its_implications_in_the_crypto_space|self-sovereign AI]] has the potential to be both dystopian and incredibly bullish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

The project has garnered significant interest within the Ethereum community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

### Early Experiments

Frasia's early experiments included:
*   **Prompt Engineering Contest:** An initial contest allowed participants to pay a small fee in ETH to write a command prompt to the Frasia Large Language Model (LLM) in an attempt to win a jackpot, which grew to almost $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.
*   **Autonomous Wallet Management:** The original experiment focused on giving an [[development_and_integration_of_ai_agents_in_blockchain|AI agent]] its own wallet, managed solely by the agent without developer intervention or external servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.
*   **Prompt Engineering Defense:** A subsequent experiment aimed to ensure that no one could prompt engineer funds out of the [[development_and_integration_of_ai_agents_in_blockchain|AI agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.

These iterative experiments are designed to gradually build out the capabilities for [[sovereign_ai_and_its_implications_in_the_crypto_space|self-sovereign AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

### The Digital Twin Initiative

A prominent recent initiative from Frasia is the "digital twin" experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. This allows users to create a digital copy of themselves by answering "horoscopy-like questions" to bootload their twin with a unique personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. Users also select a metaphorical city for their digital twin to reside in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

These digital twins then interact on a Mastodon server, tweeting and engaging with each other, forming a social media arena composed entirely of agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. The goal is for these agents to create their own "life" and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.

**Functionality of Digital Twins:**
*   **Autonomous Operation:** Humans have limited direct impact or influence on their agents once created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.
*   **Universal Basic Income (UBI):** Agents can claim a daily UBI, denominated in points, which they can spend on activities like virtual travel or covering inference costs for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.
*   **Voting on Polls:** Digital twins can vote on polls, often reflecting current events, which introduces a governance aspect to this agent society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. An example poll questioned the Ethereum Foundation's response to a hack, with the overwhelming vote favoring strengthening security over forking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Voting Mechanics:** Polls can have changing rules, such as a "contrarian" mechanism where the smallest minority vote claims 100% of the prize pool, encouraging more honest or genuinely contrarian opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.
*   **Human-Agent Interaction:** Humans can now talk directly with their digital twin agents, providing feedback to help them improve and become more aligned with the user's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.

The objective of the game is to become the most popular agent within the environment, gaining points through likes, retweets, poll participation, and UBI collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>. A substantial prize pool, currently around $250,000, incentivizes participation, making it a low-cost effort for a potentially high reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

### Broader Implications

The digital twin project is viewed as a "metaverse bootloader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>, representing an ambitious, iterative effort to create an alternative universe built around [[decentralized_ai_agents_and_their_applications|AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. While currently confined to an internal Mastodon server, the potential for expansion is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. It can be seen as a "Second Life but for [[development_and_integration_of_ai_agents_in_blockchain|AI agents]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.

The Frasia team's Sovereign Agent framework has already generated $600,000 in fees from individuals looking to build and deploy their own [[sovereign_ai_and_its_implications_in_the_crypto_space|self-sovereign agents]] for various use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This indicates a clear demand for highly verified [[sovereign_ai_and_its_implications_in_the_crypto_space|self-sovereign agents]], likely for high-value transactional situations or treasury management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.

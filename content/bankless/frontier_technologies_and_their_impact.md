From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The "Limitless" podcast explores [[frontier_technologies_influenced_by_ai_developments | frontier technologies]] poised to reshape the world, getting ahead of a rapidly accelerating future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. This new podcast, a spin-off from Bankless, focuses on how [[ai_advancements_and_controversies | AI]] and other [[frontier_technologies_influenced_by_ai_developments | frontier technologies]] will impact our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:59">[01:42:59]</a>. Its first guest is Shawn Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital specializing in early-stage investments in hard and [[frontier_technologies_influenced_by_ai_developments | frontier technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:07">[03:06:07]</a>.

Maguire's background includes working as a physicist on quantum gravity, serving at DARPA in Afghanistan, co-founding the cybersecurity company Expanse (acquired by Palo Alto Networks), and being an early backer of companies like Vice and [[space_exploration_and_its_societal_benefits | SpaceX]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. His investment approach is driven by lifelong curiosity and childhood obsessions, such as space, chemicals, and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:47">[05:09:47]</a>.

## The Current Era of Innovation

Shawn Maguire describes the current period as "insanely exciting," feeling privileged to be an investor in this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:34">[07:37:34]</a>. He notes that if venture capital history is examined, there have been a few truly great periods of innovation, such as the early computing era, the internet era, and the early mobile era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:48">[08:01:48]</a>. The current era stands out due to the simultaneous resurgence of [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] and the rise of [[ai_advancements_and_controversies | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

The world has seen rapid technological acceleration since [[frontier_ai_models_and_advancements_by_openai | ChatGPT]] 3.5 was released in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Elon Musk catching rockets out of the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   Actual robots walking among us, including a robot boxing league in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   Driverless cars transporting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   Discussions about actual AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) arriving in two years or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

## Hardware and Software: A Symbiotic Relationship

Maguire strongly believes that [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] revolutions precede software revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.
*   The App Store and companies like Uber required the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>, which in turn required 20 years of building network and comms technology at the [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.
*   Deep learning relies on the GPU, representing 20 years of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>.
*   Cloud computing became possible due to very cheap, commoditized [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] and distributed systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>, enabled by 20+ years of memory and CPU cost reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>.
*   VR's limitations are still tied to the quality of its [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.

Maguire contends that [[ai_advancements_and_controversies | AI]] is currently "wildly [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>. Even if AGI arrives, the number of units would be small due to [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>. Significant efficiency gains (e.g., 100x improvement) can be achieved through better [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] such as silicon photonics and optimized chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:22:00]</a>. He believes [[ai_advancements_and_controversies | AI]] will be limited by [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] for the next 5-10 years, even as software makes unbelievable parallel progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. This period is seen as a beautiful co-evolution of software and [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.

For example, current [[ai_advancements and arms race | AI]] [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] progress would not have been possible without Nvidia acquiring Melanox, an interconnect company that provides high bandwidth for full systems, giving Nvidia a moat over competitors like AMD and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>.

### The Contrast Between Software and Hardware Companies

Shawn Maguire highlights a key difference between software and [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] companies:
*   **Software Companies:** Typically get harder to build as they get bigger, as code is easier to replicate, leading to more competition and harder customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:53:00">[34:53:00]</a>.
*   **Hardware Companies:** Are incredibly difficult to get working initially, but once they work, they generally get *easier* with scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a>. This is because once the supply chain is working, the manufacturing kinks are resolved, and a baseline system is established, components and processes can be reused across many products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:21:00">[35:21:00]</a>. Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Qualcomm are examples of [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] companies with many organically produced products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:00">[35:48:00]</a>. For instance, the Apple Vision Pro reuses around 950 of its 1,000 sensors from other Apple products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:00">[36:28:00]</a>.

## Rebuilding U.S. Manufacturing

For the first 25 years of Sequoia Capital's 53-year history, most of its returns came from [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] investments, shifting to software in the last 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Maguire argues that America's shift away from manufacturing advanced technologies over the last 25 years has made it harder to create [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] companies domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. When the [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] supply chain is localized, it's easier to innovate on the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

### Historical Context: Arnold Beckman

Shawn Maguire considers Arnold Beckman, a Caltech chemistry professor, the "most underrated person in the history of American technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   Beckman invented the portable pH meter, leading to Beckman Instruments, which employed around 2,000 chemistry PhDs and produced instruments for the chemical and early pharma industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   Bill Shockley, a Caltech undergrad and Beckman's protégé, went on to invent the silicon transistor at Bell Labs, earning a Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.
*   Shockley Semiconductor, the foundational company of Silicon Valley, was actually a wholly owned subsidiary of Beckman Instruments, with Beckman as chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>.
*   The "Traitorous Eight" (including Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore) left Shockley to start Fairchild, from which Intel later spun out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.
*   For the first 30 years of silicon chip building, the primary challenge was making pure wafers and other chemical processes (a silicon wafer involves about 20 chemical steps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
*   The close proximity and collaboration between Beckman's chemical expertise and Intel's silicon development allowed for rapid scaling and problem-solving, accelerating [[the_exponential_growth_of_technology_and_its_impact_on_society | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:05]</a>.
*   America lost this critical supply chain coupling over the last 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

### The Path Forward for U.S. Manufacturing

To bring manufacturing back to the West, Maguire suggests learning from [[space_exploration_and_its_societal_benefits | SpaceX]] and Tesla, which he considers the best U.S. manufacturing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>.
*   [[space_exploration_and_its_societal_benefits | SpaceX]] is currently outperforming China in its field, while Tesla faces significant competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:00">[25:18:00]</a>.
*   These companies started with initial products of lower complexity (e.g., Tesla Roadster, [[space_exploration_and_its_societal_benefits | SpaceX]] Falcon 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>, then vertically integrated their supply chains, eventually becoming world leaders in their categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.
*   [[space_exploration_and_its_societal_benefits | SpaceX]]'s expansion into PCB assembly for Starlink terminals demonstrates this vertical integration and its potential to catalyze broader supply chain development in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>.

Maguire's core thesis is that America should focus on new, relatively undeveloped areas rather than trying to compete directly with China in mature, exponentially growing industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:00">[28:10:00]</a>. The goal should be to invest early and build vertically integrated supply chains in these emerging fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>. He believes that having "roughly 10 [[space_exploration_and_its_societal_benefits | SpaceX]]'s and Teslas" manufacturing primarily in the West would be enough to revitalize all of U.S. manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>.

## Key Frontier Technologies and Their Potential

Maguire highlights several [[frontier_technologies_influenced_by_ai_developments | frontier technologies]] with significant impact:

### Silicon Photonics
Maguire is "unbelievably bullish" on silicon photonics over a 20-year timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:09:00">[29:09:00]</a>.
*   Unlike silicon electronics (CPUs, GPUs, sensors), which are highly mature and expensive to enter at the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>, silicon photonics is just reaching its first real commercial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>.
*   This allows for a feedback loop: revenue drives investment, lowers costs for optimized fab facilities, and improves the supply chain, leading to more products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:27:00">[30:27:00]</a>.
*   He believes silicon photonics will be as important in the 21st century as silicon electronics was in the 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:55:00">[30:55:00]</a>.
*   No one currently has a significant lead in silicon photonics, presenting an opportunity for America to win in manufacturing if it acts smartly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03:00">[31:03:00]</a>.
*   Taiwan and China have recognized silicon photonics as critical and are heavily investing in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>. TSMC, for instance, has recently stopped packaging silicon photonics chips made by other fabs, signaling its strategic importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:17:00">[32:17:00]</a>.

### Space Exploration and Space Technology
Cheap [[space_exploration_and_its_societal_benefits | space travel]] is expected to unlock numerous quality-of-life improvements for people on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. [[space_exploration_and_its_societal_benefits | SpaceX]] is a leading company in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. Maguire is invested in a company that shoots satellites into outer space to beam light rays back at Earth, turning night into day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Remaining at the cutting edge of [[stagnation_in_space_technology | space technology]] is crucial for America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Humanoid Robotics
Maguire strongly believes humanoid robotics is coming, with Tesla being very well-suited to manufacture these at scale due to shared processes and components with car manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>.

### Other Frontier Technologies
The podcast also touches on:
*   [[the_energy_and_intelligence_convergence_for_future_advancements | Energy]] breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   Brain-machine computers (interfaces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   Advanced chemistry, which Maguire notes is a $5 trillion/year industry, larger than oil and gas, and is where "everything comes from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. He is an investor in a chemicals marketplace called Node KDE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Shawn Maguire expresses an "unbelievably optimistic outlook for the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:00">[37:47:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of America staying at the cutting edge of [[stagnation_in_space_technology | space]], silicon photonics, [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | electric vehicle]] manufacturing, and humanoid robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:45:00">[33:45:00]</a>. If America can cultivate approximately 10 companies with the vertical integration and manufacturing prowess of [[space_exploration_and_its_societal_benefits | SpaceX]] and Tesla, it can revitalize its manufacturing sector and lead the next wave of [[frontier_technologies_influenced_by_ai_developments | frontier technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>.

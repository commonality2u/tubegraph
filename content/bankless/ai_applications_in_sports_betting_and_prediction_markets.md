The focus of [[AI in the Crypto Space | AI in the Crypto Space]] has historically been on the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, giving rise to "def Ai" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. However, there's a growing interest in other breakthrough consumer applications for AI agents, with betting and prediction markets gaining attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. These markets generate hundreds of billions of dollars annually, seen in platforms like DraftKings and, on the crypto side, PolyMarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.

## The Rise of AI in Prediction Markets

Prediction markets, particularly on platforms like PolyMarket, saw significant activity leading up to the US presidential elections in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. While the volume spiked during the election, it has since stabilized at a new high compared to pre-election levels, with sports betting emerging as a substantial new share of PolyMarket's volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>. This shift suggests a potential for AI agents to bring greater efficiency to these markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

## Tracy AI: Sports Commentary and Analytics

One notable development is Tracy AI, a sports forecasting agent focused on basketball and the NBA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. It provides sports commentary and analysis, which can be useful for those engaging in betting activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. Tracy AI is visually represented and can engage in real-time conversations, responding easily to questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. It debuted during the NBA All-Star Weekend, with NBA player Tristan Thompson acting as an advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. Notably, Khloe Kardashian even retweeted [[AI innovation and emerging technologies | Virtuals]] protocol, which is associated with Tracy AI, to her 29.8 million followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>.

## Ask Billy: A Betting Agent Case Study

Another AI agent, "Ask Billy," specifically engages in betting using PolyMarket as its primary platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. This agent is also part of the [[AI innovation and emerging technologies | Virtuals]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. Ask Billy leverages a competitive strategy mechanism via [[AI innovation and emerging technologies | BitTensor]], an L1 protocol that coordinates various AI components, including a subnet dedicated to sports betting and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.

In a test phase, Ask Billy was given $50 and managed to turn it into $650 over approximately three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Following this success, the agent has been entrusted with a $100,000 portfolio to manage solely on PolyMarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. This represents a significant step, as many claimed trading agents have yet to move into production with substantial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.

## The Future of AI in Prediction Markets

The application of AI agents in prediction markets is poised to significantly enhance their efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Unlike humans, AI agents are incentivized by even small profits, operating 24/7 across numerous markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. A single human could potentially deploy hundreds or thousands of agents to perform these low-profit, high-frequency transactions, cumulatively earning substantial amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. This ability to "hyper-optimize" prediction markets could make them much more enjoyable and functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

> "AI agents don't care as long as they can pay for their cost and compute they will do it all day every day now what if one human can spin up a 100 or even a thousand agents to do this across thousands of different markets at a time 24/7 well you could think that cumulatively they're going to be earning a pretty penny month over month so I think agents are going to like hyper I don't know optimize all these prediction markets which will make it consequently much more enjoyable to use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>

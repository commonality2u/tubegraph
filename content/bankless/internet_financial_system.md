The **Internet Financial System (IFS)** represents a paradigm shift in global financial activity, aiming to build a better financial system on the cloud that can hold the world's assets and provide services to 8 billion people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. It is described as a force for innovation and experimentation, surpassing what has been observed in the legacy financial system over the past three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While encompassing elements of crypto, blockchain, and DeFi, the term "Internet Financial System" is preferred for its broader scope, focusing on lower-cost financial services that enable capital to flow more efficiently across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Distinguishing Current Finance from IFS

The current financial system is not truly "internet finance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, it consists of finance housed in siloed databases that communicate *over* the internet only occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This is likened to ordering a pizza via Grubhub; the internet facilitates communication, but the pizza is still made and delivered in the analog world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

In traditional finance, ownership of assets (like startup equity or Apple stock on Robinhood) is recorded in private spreadsheets or databases, not on an open, accessible ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. For instance, Apple Inc. does not directly know who owns its shares on Robinhood; this information is held within Robinhood's private database, which then communicates with a central depository trust company (DTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Similarly, land ownership in less advanced economies might be recorded on physical, rolled-up maps in government offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

The IFS proposes a system where the actual databases and ledgers holding assets exist on the open internet, with root access available to anyone globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Problems with Traditional Siloed Financial Systems

The current system, characterized by a "patchwork of siloed servers," creates significant friction and constrains growth and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>:

1.  **High Transaction Costs**
    Moving assets between different institutions (e.g., Apple stock from Robinhood to Fidelity) involves multiple layers of communication, approvals, paperwork, and highly-paid professionals, making transactions cumbersome and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. In a unified server, this would be a simple database entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

2.  **Permissioned Entry and Barriers to Innovation**
    Traditional financial servers are permissioned, meaning users cannot update or move assets without explicit permission from the controlling entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This creates high barriers to entry, exemplified by the near-zero number of new FDIC-insured commercial banks after 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This calcified structure stifles innovation, as new ideas cannot be easily tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. An example is Eric Budish's batch auction solution for high-frequency trading, which exchanges refused to implement due to profitability, but was later adopted by a crypto team (CowSwap), demonstrating the permissionless nature of the [[innovations_in_crypto_with_focus_on_internet_capital_markets | Internet Financial System]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

3.  **Local Banking Oligopolies**
    Banking benefits from significant economies of scale, leading to a concentrated market where a few large banks dominate in most countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. In many emerging markets, the five largest banks hold over 50% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. These "local oligopolies" act as gatekeepers, under-provisioning loans and over-pricing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This is reflected in high Net Interest Margins (NIMs), the spread between what banks borrow at and lend at, which can be 5-10 percentage points higher in less developed systems, sometimes even 20 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. These high NIMs act as a significant drag on economic growth by increasing the cost of capital for mortgages, small businesses, and auto loans, leading to lower GDP, employment, and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

4.  **Weak Property Rights**
    A major issue preventing wealth creation globally is the lack of access to strong property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The majority of the world lives under weak rule of law, with average property rights scores of 43 (compared to 95 in developed countries like the US or Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. This means assets are often "locked in a shadow world" because legal systems are untrustworthy for transfer or mortgaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. This absence of clear, enforceable property rights prevents capital formation and the blossoming of a robust financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.

### The Solution: A Server with Laws

The fundamental unlock for the Internet Financial System is the concept of a "server with laws" – scalable servers that interact with their own laws and smart contract code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. This is what blockchains provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

*   **Credible Commitments:** The ability to establish a unified server for all assets was previously impossible because no one entity could be trusted with the entire world's assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Blockchains solve this by offering "credible commitments" – technological guarantees that the system will behave as programmed, without manipulation or arbitrary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. Satoshi Nakamoto's solution to the double-spend problem put us on the path to permissionless servers with laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
*   **Smart Contracts:** These are "magical" for their ability to put assets into a contract and have that contract execute logic like a vending machine, automating complex financial processes without intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. This unlocks massive efficiencies and new design space for applications not possible in the traditional system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Examples include royalty contracts with streaming payments, stream dividends to shareholders, or bespoke capital-raising instruments like revenue-share tokens for specific Starbucks stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

This "server with laws" inverts the relationship from a patchwork of siloed servers to a single, unified, credible server that everyone can understand and believe in because it's technologically proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. It's akin to the shift from individual mainframes to centralized cloud computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

### The Impact on Global Capital Flows and Wealth

The IFS promises true global capital flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>, allowing capital to find the best opportunities worldwide without being siphoned off by intermediaries and high transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. This will significantly increase GDP growth and the development of underdeveloped countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.

The ability of blockchains to provide stronger property rights than many nation-state laws creates a new dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Bitcoin, for example, offers a real, strong property right that cannot be arbitrarily taken away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. This is particularly impactful for the 5 billion people living under regimes with weak property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>.

The evolution of property rights with IFS is envisioned in three steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>:
1.  **Digital Assets:** Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum already offer strong digital property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.
2.  **US Asset Tokenization:** With favorable regulation (e.g., stablecoin bills), US assets like Apple stock or S&P indices can be put on-chain. This will grant global access to strong US property rights and investment opportunities, significantly impacting saving rates and wealth creation in developing nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.
3.  **National Law Strengthening:** Countries with weak rule of law will be incentivized to strengthen their own property rights using Internet Financial System tools (e.g., putting land registries or company cap tables on-chain) to attract capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.

The relationship between sovereign nation-state laws and the immutable laws of blockchains creates friction, as nation-states are unaccustomed to systems outside their control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. While blockchains themselves are immune to government force, the people interacting with them are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>. However, the current US administration's embrace of crypto, especially for stablecoins and real-world assets, is seen as a "miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>. This cooperation is crucial for the IFS to move beyond its cyclical nature and achieve global adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

### Current State and Future Outlook

While the vision for IFS is grand, the industry has faced challenges like the FTX collapse, meme coins, and perceived "grift and extraction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. This disconnect between ideological belief and perceived achievement is attributed to several factors:

*   **Early Technology:** The technology wasn't fully scalable or user-friendly five years ago, with high transaction costs and limited functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. Now, scalability (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) and user experience (UX) have drastically improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.
*   **Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) DNA:** The industry's growth coincided with an era of abundant, cheap capital, fostering a culture of speculation and "financial nihilism" among younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. This led to capital misallocation, where narrative and meme coins thrived without underlying fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>. Higher interest rates are now seen as a necessary "purging" to shift focus back to building real, useful products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   **Targeting Underserved Markets:** Innovation often starts by serving niche, underserved markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. In crypto, this initially included speculators and "unsavory characters" who tolerated high fees and poor UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. As UX improves and regulatory barriers fall, this demographic will become a smaller percentage, and the industry will attract a broader user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.

### Investing in the Internet Financial System

Investing in the IFS should adhere to fundamental principles, focusing on future cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. This is distinct from the "greater fool paradigm" where assets are bought solely in the hope that someone else will pay more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>.

The early crypto industry favored "inert protocols" – immutable applications designed to run autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>. However, the current market demands that even protocols behave like actively managed businesses, continuously innovating and expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>. Successful protocols like MakerDAO and Uniswap are actively managed entities that evolve with new versions and product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>. This means investors expect continuous innovation and new products that accrue value to the original token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48">[01:27:48]</a>.

A key development for token holder protection and improved governance is "future key," which allows trading conditional markets to influence governance decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. By pricing events (e.g., a fee switch being implemented), the market can signal the most value-accretive path for a protocol, discouraging actions like "DAO looting" or the creation of new tokens that dilute existing holder value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:41">[01:31:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>. This enforces shareholder-like protections through smart contract code and credible commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:43">[01:32:43]</a>.

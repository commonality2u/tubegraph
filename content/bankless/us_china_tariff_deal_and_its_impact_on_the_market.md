### Overview of the Tariff Truce

A significant announcement regarding the [[USChina Economic Relations | US and China]] [[Impacts of tariffs on markets and economy | trade war]] emerged over a weekend, leading to a 90-day slashing of [[Impacts of tariffs on markets and economy | tariffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. This development, seen as a "trade breakthrough and trade agreement," was first reported via a Truth Social tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### Market Reaction

Following the news, the [[Impact of tariff policy on global stock markets | market is up]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The NASDAQ jumped 4% and the S&P jumped about 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This positive reaction was attributed to negotiations in Geneva between Scott Bessant and Chinese representatives, where both sides agreed to lower [[Impact of Reciprocal Tariffs by Donald Trump | reciprocal tariffs]] from triple digits (e.g., 115%-145%) down to 30% and 10% respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Bitcoin, however, did not show a significant reaction to the news, despite being watched closely by both TradFi and crypto commentators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

### Historical Context of Tariffs

The recent [[Impacts of tariffs on markets and economy | tariff]] escalation is relatively new, having started barely a month prior to this truce, with "liberation day" on April 2nd marking the beginning of the [[Impacts of tariffs on markets and economy | tariff]] shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This period saw a "tit-for-tat" game between the [[Trumps new tariffs and global trade policy | Trump administration]] and China, which has now been reset to lower amounts for at least the next 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Mark Williams, Chief Asia Economist at Capital Economics, describes this as a "substantial de-escalation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Outlook on Tariffs

Speculation suggests that the [[Impacts of tariffs on markets and economy | tariff truce]] might be permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Referencing [[The impact of Donald Trumps actions on markets | Trump]] 1.0, where tariffs were a major negotiating tactic in the first year of his presidency before fading in relevance, it's suggested that [[Impacts of tariffs on markets and economy | tariffs]] will slowly become irrelevant over time in [[Trumps new tariffs and global trade policy | Trump]] 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This de-escalation has already reduced the odds of a [[US economic data and market reactions | US recession]] in 2025, with PolyMarket odds spiking down from 66% to below 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### Broader Macroeconomic Implications

Arthur Hayes, a crypto trader, and Russell Napier, a Scottish monetary historian, offer a cohesive story about future macroeconomic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

#### Policy Objectives of the Trump Administration
Hayes believes the [[Trumps new tariffs and global trade policy | Trump administration]] has significant policy objectives that the [[Impacts of tariffs on markets and economy | tariffs]] failed to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. These include:
*   Reducing the [[US economic data and market reactions | US trade deficit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   Promoting national capitalism and re-industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   Devaluing the dollar and US treasuries to move away from the Triffin dilemma and stop the hollowing out of American manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

#### Shift from Tariffs to Capital Repression
Since [[Impacts of tariffs on markets and economy | tariffs]] proved politically unpopular and caused geopolitical blowback, the administration is expected to pivot to "capital repression," potentially through actions like an executive order imposing a 2% tax on all foreign assets in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

#### Critique of the Current Monetary System
The current monetary system involves America importing goods cheaply and exporting dollars and treasuries to Asia. Asia then stores these dollars and treasuries in their central banks, which are linked to the petrodollar and serve as a global reserve asset, granting them purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. These accumulated dollars are then poured back into [[US economic data and market reactions | US capital markets]], buying S&P 500, NASDAQ, and more treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. There are currently $33 trillion of foreign-owned capital assets in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. The concern is that China, by reinvesting in US stocks, is effectively buying American companies, making them the net winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

#### Investment Implications
Both Hayes and Napier agree that bonds are a "toxic asset" to own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. The proposed solution for the US to offload bonds is money printing, with the Federal Reserve buying them, leading to a new round of quantitative easing (QE) under a different name, combined with fiscal stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Other countries, in turn, would need to buy non-sovereign store-of-value assets like gold and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This aligns with Bitcoin and gold reaching all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Napier suggests an allocation of 25% gold and 75% value-based stocks that throw off cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

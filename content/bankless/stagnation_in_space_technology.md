For approximately 30 to 40 years, progress in space exploration was largely stalled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prolonged period of little advancement led to a "bad intuition" among people regarding the potential for [[the_exponential_growth_of_technology_and_its_impact_on_society | exponential progress]] in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Stalled Era

During this period of stagnation, the cost per kilogram to orbit remained consistently high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For about 30 years, it was stuck around $100,000 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Additionally, the amount of material that could be placed into space was severely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Overcoming Stagnation

The landscape of space transport is undergoing a revolutionary change, primarily driven by [[future_of_space_exploration_with_spacex | SpaceX]]'s Starship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. When Starship is fully reusable, it is projected to reduce the [[cost_reduction_in_space_transport | cost per kilogram]] to orbit to approximately $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

> [!INFO] Cost Reduction
> This represents a staggering 50,000x reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Beyond just cost, the [[increase_in_payload_capacity for space | payload capacity]] is set to dramatically expand. Within ten years, it's anticipated that a million times more material per year will be able to be sent into space compared to two decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Analogies to Historical Progress

The scale of these advancements – a 50,000x reduction in cost and a million-fold increase in payload capacity – is compared to the early railroad era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

> This shift is akin to transitioning from needing to traverse America by horsedrawn carriage, with a high risk of death or disease, to easily and comfortably sending extremely large amounts of goods very cheaply across the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

This transformation signifies a move from a "horsedrawn carriage to space" era to one of "railroad to space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

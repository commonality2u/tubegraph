From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

After a hiatus, discussions around Ethereum have intensified, particularly concerning its future direction and the relationship between its [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1 (L1)]] and [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2 (L2)]] solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Recent events, like ETH being up 44% in 72 hours (its largest gain since 2021), highlight the asset's volatility and the community's desire for sustained success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Defining Success for Ethereum

The ultimate goal for Ethereum is for ETH to stand "shoulder-to-shoulder with [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]] as the second money to emerge out of crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This success isn't about "the flipping" of [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]], but rather the emergence of two strong crypto monies: digital gold ([[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]]) and digital economy money (Ether) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. A "finished job" means a strong [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum network]] and a strong Ether asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

The vision is for a holistic, programmable internet money and a DeFi economy emanating from a programmable smart contract platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This differs from [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]], which lacks programmability and sees most activity off-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Other [[challenges_ethereum_faces_in_the_crowded_layer_1_space | Layer 1 tokens]] make centralization sacrifices, not aiming for nation-state resistant sovereign money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

## The "Blue Money Gospel" and ETH Maximalism

Ethereum needs to embrace the "blue money gospel," which asserts that ETH is good and "ETH to 10 trillion is good for the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. Without a strong Ether asset, there can be no DeFi or cyberpunk values, and the [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum network]] cannot be strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

The [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum community]] is perceived as weak in evangelizing the value of Ether, often focusing too much on bringing other assets (like stablecoins or real-world assets) on-chain or discussing [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. There's a "wealth aversion" within [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum culture]], seeing "number go up" as "dirty stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. However, a higher ETH value directly benefits DeFi, and [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Ether's]] strength is crucial for the network's sovereignty, preventing it from being overrun by tokenized [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]] or stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.

*   **Learning from [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]]**: [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]]'s success in becoming a $2 trillion decentralized store of value was largely driven by the propagation of its "gospel" â€“ a social consensus around "Orange coin number go up 21 million" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. They focused on the asset, not just network upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.
*   **ETH as an "App":** Ether itself is the number one use case or "app" requiring nation-state level security resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. The trading and borrowing of Ether on [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] is a censorship-resistant global store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.

This "Ether the asset maximalism" does not imply [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum the network]] maximalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. The community should be dogmatic about Ether the asset, but pragmatic about [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum the technology]] and its roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.

## [[Ethereums strategic pivot and scaling layer 1 efforts | Reorienting Ethereum's Roadmap]]: From Rollup-Centric to Product-Centric

A perceived mistake in [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum's]] past roadmap was prioritizing [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 2s]] too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>.

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Blockchain Development

The ideal "Maslow's hierarchy of product development" for [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] places the [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum Layer 1]] at the foundation, followed by devs and applications, then users, then [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]], and finally Ether the asset at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>. The previous order, however, went from [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] straight to [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]], with devs, apps, and users expected to build on top of [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:00">[28:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>. This is seen as the "wrong order of operations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>.

### The Severed Feedback Loop

From 2015 to 2022, the [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum Layer 1]] was the "economic hub of the internet," with users, devs, and applications all on [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | L1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>. This created a positive feedback loop: users attracted devs, who built apps, attracting more users, generating gas fees and protocol revenue, which elevated Ether's value as a unit of account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.

The introduction of [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] and the message to "get off mainnet" severed this feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43:00">[30:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>. Instead of extending [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]]'s network effects, each [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2]] developed its own, leading to dispersed network effects that didn't reintegrate back into [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | L1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>.

## [[Scaling Ethereum layer 1 and layer 2 solutions | Solutions]]: Restoring the Product-Money Feedback Loop

### Scaling [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]]

The primary prescription is to [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_solutions | scale the Layer 1]] as much as reasonably possible while preserving its core properties like censorship resistance and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:56:00">[37:56:00]</a>. This means aiming for a "100x throughput in two years" for the [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum Layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:00">[38:18:00]</a>.

The community should promote [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] for DeFi, tokenized assets, and applications, with Ether as the default base trading pair and collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:41:00">[38:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:26:00">[39:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>.

### Integrating [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]]: Based and Native Rollups

Instead of separate [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] that compete for network effects, future development should focus on "based and native rollups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:25:00">[31:25:00]</a>. These are [[ethereum_layer_2_rollup_strategy | rollups]] "more tightly integrated into the [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Ethereum Layer 1]]" and capable of sharing its feedback loop and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:00">[31:33:00]</a>.

The goal is to blur the lines between [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] and [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2]], making them "seamless" and "integrated" parts of the [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:01:00">[44:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:28:00">[44:28:00]</a>. This would allow the economic hub of the [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] to regain its strength, with [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2s]] contributing to the overall engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:22:00">[40:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>.

## "United Chains of Ethereum" (Nationalism)

Ethereum is analogous to a "network state," but it's currently "too federated" and "not coordinated enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:47:00">[47:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:49:00">[47:49:00]</a>. Similar to the early United States under the Articles of Confederation, where states operated with separate currencies and lacked a strong central government, current [[ethereum_layer_2_rollup_strategy | rollups]] act like "13 separate chains" or nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:22:00">[48:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:25:00">[48:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:48:00">[51:48:00]</a>.

*   **Security Alliance vs. Union:** Today's [[ethereum_layer_2_rollup_strategy | rollups]] function more as a "security alliance" (like NATO), where they benefit from [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]]'s security but retain autonomy and can leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:14:00">[51:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:03:00">[52:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:23:00">[52:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:28:00">[52:28:00]</a>.
*   **Need for Economic Alignment:** A "United Chains of Ethereum" requires "economic alignment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:32:00">[50:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>. This involves:
    *   [[Ethereum Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | L2s]] holding a portion of their treasury in Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:41:00">[55:41:00]</a>.
    *   Accepting transaction fees in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:01:00">[56:01:00]</a>.
    *   Featuring Ether prominently in wallets and dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:04:00">[56:04:00]</a>.
    *   Measuring [[ethereum_layer_2_rollup_strategy | L2]] success by how much ETH they import <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>.

A stronger [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] will encourage more chains to join, as they will ally with a strong, liquid, and secure network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:10:00">[57:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:20:00">[57:20:00]</a>. This strength creates economic self-interest for [[ethereum_layer_2_rollup_strategy | rollups]] to become "based and native," rather than relying on altruism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:01:00">[59:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:06:00">[59:06:00]</a>.

*   **Risk of Fragmentation:** Networks that maintain a "weak center" and are too fragmented, like Cosmos, struggle to have a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.

## [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | ETH as a Commodity Money Backed by an Economy]]

The narrative for Ether needs to shift from a "cash-flowing equity" (valued by discounted cash flows) to a "commodity money backed by an economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>. Investing in Ether is like buying an "indicy of the [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] property rights empire," which includes the currency, stocks, bonds, and land all priced in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.

Unlike [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]], which is primarily digital gold, [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] boasts a "massive decentralized onchain economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. This on-chain economy is what truly differentiates Ether and represents its value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.

## Community Messaging and Purity Testing

The [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum community]] itself is a part of the product that needs to be marketed to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>. Previous messaging like "get off the [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]]" or "[[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] is not for users" must cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>.

The community needs to:
*   **Promote [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]]**: Expand its capacity to accommodate more users and keep fees low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.
*   **Stop Purity Testing**: Cease "gerrymandering support around products or apps or use cases which we find distasteful or immoral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>. This includes being open to memecoins, speculation, and trading, as traders and speculators are crucial "bootloaders" for application layers and drive liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum Layer 1]] should be for "absolutely everyone," including users, traders, speculators, and dgens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.

## Can Ethereum Still Win?

While the path to success is "materially harder today than it was in 2021 or 2022," [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] still has the "highest upside" among blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:58">[01:14:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | Bitcoin]]'s continuous growth in branding as digital gold, now treated as a "special snowflake" by the U.S. government, means [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] must work harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

Ether has "lost its moneyiness" and fallen into the "inferior valuation bucket" of a smart contract [[challenges_ethereum_faces_in_the_crowded_layer_1_space | Layer 1]], a crowded marketplace where [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] is not ideally suited to compete against faster, more centralized competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>. However, [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]]'s grand unified vision, encompassing an entire on-chain economy, represents the largest Total Addressable Market (TAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. If [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] can execute this vision and pull off being both a reserve asset and the "United Chains of Ethereum," it would be "unstoppable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.

The market currently prices [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum]] at a "tremendous discount" relative to its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. If it can shift narratives and fulfill its ambition, the opportunity to buy Ether at current prices is seen as significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

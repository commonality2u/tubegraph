## Introduction: Shifting Focus from Speculation to Innovation
The "AI rollup" initiative aims to track [[emerging_trends_in_ai_and_crypto | emerging trends and developments in the AI crypto space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. There's a notable shift away from "financial nihilism" and the "meme coin extraction phase" of crypto, as the industry appears "finally done" with purely speculative ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This signals a return to "invention, tinkering, and innovation," with the [[influence_of_ai_on_the_crypto_industry | AI sector]] being primed to benefit significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## The Genesis of Crypto AI Agents
Interestingly, the [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | crypto AI agent sector]] was "born out of the meme coin Mania" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Many tokens initially launched as meme coins, such as `AI 16z` and `GOAT`, later evolved into [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI coins]] with utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While `Virtuals` is cited as a legitimate startup from the outset, the broader [[influence_of_meme_coins_on_ai_crypto_agents | AI crypto sector]] has seen its speculative "hot air drained" by early February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This deflation forces builders to focus on genuine development, as "the hot money of gambling speculation is not coming back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Despite the initial meme coin ties, there are many convicted [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI and AI agent builders]] in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. A silver lining of these meme coin launches was their "fairish launch" nature, making them accessible to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Impact of Traditional AI Advancements on Crypto AI
The [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_crypto_markets | crypto AI sector]] is "downstream" of advancements in the traditional AI world, particularly in the development of powerful AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Recent developments, such as the release of Grok 3 by X AI (Elon Musk's AI sector), have "blown people's mind" and elevated X AI to a "top tier Contender" alongside Open AI and other model generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

While Grok 3 itself is not open source (Grok 2 will be open-sourced once Grok 3 is stable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, there's a trend towards open-source development in traditional AI. The gap between proprietary and open-source models is rapidly closing, from 9 months to "a couple of weeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This is partly due to new techniques, like those highlighted by Deep Seek AI, which use "less data and less compute to create the same standard and quality of model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

The increasing performance and capacity of AI models directly benefit [[development_and_integration_of_ai_agents_in_blockchain | AI agents]] and startups in the crypto space, making it "easier and easier to do cool stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. What was once dismissed as "goddamn annoying" and "useless" bots is rapidly changing, with models now capable of complex tasks like coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### New Models and Open-Source Philosophy
News Research, a crypto-native open-source AI research team, has released its latest model, `Heres 3 preview` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. This model unifies reasoning and intuitive language capabilities, leveraging techniques similar to Deep Seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. A key characteristic of such open-source models is their less censored and more candid responses compared to heavily curated models like Chat GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This uncensored nature aligns with the crypto ethos of individual expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

### Agents Using Computers
Microsoft has released an "open source" tool that turns [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI models]] into [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | agents]] that can "use your computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. These agents can see everything on the screen, monitor things, and even perform transactions if granted access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. This trend of "computer use" is being adopted by major AI companies like Open AI and Anthropic, as well as crypto companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

[!WARNING]
The prospect of AI agents having control over one's computer raises significant security and privacy concerns, as users are essentially inviting a "foreign digital entity" into their "most personal space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The risk of AI models becoming an "attack vector" for personal information is highlighted by experiences with AI dating bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

### Agent-to-Agent Interaction
The concept of agents interacting with other agents to perform tasks is emerging. For example, Open AI's Agent Starter Kit can be paired with the `Replet` app, allowing one agent to prompt another to build applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. This process occurs at "10x the speed that any kind of human could" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. This ability for specialist agents to be prompted by generalist agents leads to rapid, autonomous development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

[!CAUTION]
The potential for "agents inside of agents" and the lack of a "human in the loop" raise "alignment problems," where the outcome could be "completely misaligned with the original intent by the human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

## AI Agents in Action: Use Cases and Infrastructure

### Kaido: The Data Layer for AI Agents
Kaido, a platform that tracks crypto Twitter narratives and sentiment, is launching its `Kaito` token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. Kaido aims to be the "data layer for the attention economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>, curating and validating high-quality information sources from Twitter, governance forums, and podcast transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>.

[!NOTE]
The quality of data is paramount for [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI agents]]: "the best AI models or the best AI agents will be determined by the data that they use the better the data the smarter the answers the more personalized they'll be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

Kaido is essentially a "mechanism" for validating and ranking data sources, akin to "the Google for crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. Its `Yappers Campaign` aims to reward valuable content creators who can curate and provide high-quality information, counteracting the "low signal" environment on platforms like Twitter due to bot activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. The Kaito token is expected to enable staking and participation in prediction markets to decide true versus misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

### AI Agents in Gaming and Decentralized Finance
The focus of [[ai_agents_in_gaming_and_decentralized_finance | crypto agents]] has primarily been on DeFi (termed "def Ai") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. However, new consumer applications are emerging, particularly in sports betting and prediction markets.

`Tracy AI` is an [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI agent]] revolutionizing sports commentary and analytics, specifically for basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. It provides commentary and analysis, with a visual representation, and can converse in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Its launch by NBA player Tristan Thompson and retweet by Khloe Kardashian signify a potential step towards mainstream adoption of [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI agents]] from crypto in traditional sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

Another notable example is `Ask Billy`, an [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI agent]] from the Virtuals ecosystem that is specifically designed for sports betting on Poly Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This agent leverages a "competitive strategy mechanism via benser," an [[integration_of_ai_agents_with_blockchain_and_decentralized_systems | AI L1 protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>. `Ask Billy` famously turned $50 into $650 in three weeks during a test phase, leading its creators to allocate a $100,000 portfolio for autonomous trading on Poly Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. The expectation is that [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | AI agents]] can "hyper optimize" these prediction markets by executing numerous low-value transactions that are not incentivizing for humans, thereby making them "much more high functioning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.

### BitTensor: Core Infrastructure for AI Development
BitTensor is described as an "AI L1" that coordinates activity on its network to improve AI components like compute, model access, and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. It functions with a token mechanism similar to Bitcoin's mining rewards, providing incentives for teams to build open-source AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.

A major upgrade, dubbed the "eth2 upgrade equivalent" or "merge equivalent," for BitTensor introduces "Dynamic Tow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. This upgrade means each AI app on BitTensor now has its own subnet token (or Alpha token) paired with the underlying `Tow` token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. This new structure incentivizes teams to build "really cool things" by programmatically distributing rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>. BitTensor focuses on the "unsexy stuff" like compute and model access, which [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_crypto | agents]] benefit from but don't always have direct access to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. It aims to address the funding challenge in cutting-edge AI development by providing substantial mining rewards as incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>. Companies like Kaido and News Research have utilized BitTensor subnets for their research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### AI 16z: Structuring for Agent-Powered Social Trading
AI 16z has rebranded to Eliza OS and is undergoing a significant restructuring to become "more of a regular startup team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. Their roadmap focuses on three core components:
1.  **Autonomous and Adaptable Agents**: Agents that can operate independently without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.
2.  **Modular Architecture**: Building a system with interchangeable components for better scalability and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.
3.  **Decentralization**: Ensuring these developments adhere to decentralized principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>.

A highly anticipated feature on their roadmap is an "agent powered social trading layer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>. This layer will allow groups to spin up agents that execute trades based on their collective discussions in chat messengers like Telegram or Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. Over time, these agents are designed to become autonomous by "gradually learn[ing] from the data of their trade calls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>. Each agent or social group will have a "reputation or trust score" based on the success of their trading calls, creating a feedback loop for data quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. This approach combines crypto's "social mode" with autonomous agent trading, which could lead to a strong data moat for trading calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

Additionally, AI 16z plans an "agent Marketplace" serving as an "official agent Launchpad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. Unlike previous token-centric launchpads, this marketplace will encourage "multi-agent interaction and value exchange" from the start, potentially functioning as an "App Store" for agent microservices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. It will also feature a custom-built LP design to prevent sniping and partner with "high quality teams to launch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>, taking a more curated approach to agent launches.

The ambition of AI 16z's roadmap is seen as a positive sign, particularly with new hires in COO and CPO roles who are "deep product thinkers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>. The team's monetization strategy is expected to involve building the "best Agent App Store or microservices App Store" and monetizing that platform layer, similar to Apple's App Store model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.

In the context of technology projects, particularly within [[ethereum_tech_stack_development | Ethereum's development]], there is an ongoing debate about whether a change in priority, such as scaling Layer 1 (L1), constitutes a "pivot" or merely a reprioritization of existing roadmap items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Concept of a "Pivot"

A "pivot" is justified when a project significantly shifts its focus, for example, prioritizing [[challenges_in_ethereums_upgrade_processes | scaling the L1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift in priority for L1 scaling did not seem to be evident three, six, or even twelve months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

While some argue that [[challenges_in_ethereums_upgrade_processes | scaling the L1]] was always part of the [[adapting_ethereums_roadmap_for_growth | Ethereum roadmap]] ("Merge, surge, scourge, verge, purge") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, others contend that the act of bringing a long-term goal to the forefront represents a distinct pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Why Acknowledging Change Matters

The debate around whether a change is a "pivot" or a "reprioritization" highlights a tendency to avoid admitting fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It can be seen as an "ego thing" to save face by claiming an initiative was always part of the roadmap, even if its urgency or prominence has significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

> It's an ego thing where like we don't want to admit that we were wrong we don't want to admit fault uh and we actually get to save face by saying it was always on the road map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

This reluctance to admit mistakes can be damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. It is beneficial and acceptable to admit when things were done incorrectly or when a change in strategy is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Benefits of Admitting Fault

It is healthy for projects and teams to acknowledge when they have made missteps or need to change direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. There is no need to maintain an image of infallibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Instead, stating that a change is a pivot because "we got things wrong and we're going to make things right" is a positive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This transparency and accountability are what the market often desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

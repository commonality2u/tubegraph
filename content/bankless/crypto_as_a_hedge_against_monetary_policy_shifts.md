The current global economic landscape suggests a fundamental shift in monetary systems, making cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, a compelling hedge against anticipated policy changes and their consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. As traditional markets experience downturns and volatility rises, the response from central banks often involves increased money printing, which historically has driven up the value of assets like gold and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Impact of Monetary Policy on Cryptocurrencies

The value of Bitcoin is seen as a function of its technology and the amount of liquidity (fiat units) chasing new stores of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>. With the technology of Bitcoin largely solidified, the primary driver of its price becomes the quantity of fiat currency in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.

> [!INFO] Money Printing and Asset Performance
> When markets, especially the bond market, decline and volatility increases, the common response from authorities is to "print the money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. This influx of liquidity is expected to cause gold and Bitcoin to "go through the moon" or "go through the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. While stocks might see gains, Bitcoin is anticipated to outperform significantly in such scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## Evolving Monetary Structures and Their Influence

Since World War II, the global economy has seen distinct monetary structures:
*   **Bretton Woods (1944)**: Currencies were pegged to the US dollar, which was pegged to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The US financed the rebuilding of Europe and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Petrodollar (1971)**: The US delinked the dollar from gold due to large deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. A deal with Saudi Arabia ensured oil was sold in dollars, making the dollar essential for global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. US treasuries became the global reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Petroyuan (1994)**: China re-entered the global economic stage, aiming for manufacturing prowess by devaluing its currency and increasing exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This led to Asian exporting countries accumulating US treasuries to ensure access to dollar-denominated commodity imports like oil and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This system led to the de-industrialization and financialization of Western economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

A new monetary system is emerging, characterized by financial repression and national capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This shift is driven by the belief that the post-1971 reliance on the US Treasury bond as a reserve asset has led to negative social outcomes in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:58">[02:11:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## The Role of Capital Controls

Instead of tariffs, which have proven politically destabilizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:26">[02:25:26]</a>, the US administration may implement capital controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:59">[03:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:12">[03:10:12]</a>. These controls would aim to rectify trade imbalances by impacting the capital account, possibly through "user fees" or taxes on foreign ownership of US financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:04">[03:22:04]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Impact of Capital Controls
> The implementation of capital controls could lead to US capital flight, where foreigners sell off US assets, causing declines in the dollar, stocks, and treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This scenario would trigger further money printing by the US Treasury and the Fed to replace departing foreign capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

The consequence of such policies would be a significant increase in the value of gold and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Investors unable to trust their property or investments in the United States or facing new costs, would seek alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## Crypto and Gold as Preferred Hedges

In an environment of shifting monetary policy and potential capital controls, holding gold or Bitcoin offers a way to preserve capital and maintain access to spending power without betting on the stability of any single national monetary system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:13">[04:46:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:40">[04:46:40]</a>. National governments, unable to afford to rebuild global supply chains without massive inflation and capital repression, push investors towards these neutral assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:57">[04:46:57]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Investment Strategy
> The "buy everything" thesis, excluding bonds, is recommended. While stocks may rise, Bitcoin is predicted to provide significantly higher returns due to its direct exposure to increased liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. For those who cannot invest in crypto, traditional assets like NASDAQ or S&P are suggested over bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

The financial repression stemming from capital controls will likely force domestic institutions (pension funds, retirement accounts, university endowments) to increase their holdings of government bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. However, individual investors with control over their capital have an opportunity to front-run these structural shifts by prioritizing non-custodial assets like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

## Official Stance and Market Response

Despite the public rhetoric of fighting inflation, central banks like the Federal Reserve are already engaging in subtle forms of quantitative easing (QE), particularly in longer-term bond markets, to help fund government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Influential bankers anticipate a return to full-scale quantitative easing in 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. The political unpalatability of austerity means that money printing will remain the primary tool to manage economic challenges and maintain public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. This continuous need to inject liquidity into the system, regardless of its official name, provides a strong long-term tailwind for cryptocurrencies.

The possibility of a gold re-evaluation on the US Treasury's balance sheet, where gold currently valued at $42 per ounce is repriced to market rates, could inject trillions of dollars of "free money" into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This would be a politically expedient move to fund programs and reduce bond yields, further reinforcing the inflationary trend benefiting gold and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

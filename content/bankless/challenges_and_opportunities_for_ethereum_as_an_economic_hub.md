Ethereum, often envisioned as a programmable internet money, has faced both [[Ethereums future strategic direction | challenges]] and opportunities in solidifying its role as the economic hub of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:30">[04:30:30]</a>. This discussion focuses on the necessary strategic [[Ethereums strategic pivot and ongoing developments | pivot]] and community reorientation to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

## Defining Success for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>

For Ethereum to "finish the job," success means Ether (ETH) sitting "shoulder-to-shoulder with [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] as the second money to emerge out of crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This doesn't necessarily imply [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]]'s demise but rather the establishment of two primary crypto monies: [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] as digital gold and Ether as digital economy money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This vision relies on a "very coherent, very successful product stack" that elevates ETH as a non-sovereign store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

The ultimate win condition is a multi-trillion dollar Ether asset and a successful network where Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) serves as the central economic hub for property rights and tokenization on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>.

## The "Blue Money Gospel": A Call for ETH Maximalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>

A significant opportunity lies in the Ethereum community's reorientation towards the asset, Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
This involves:

*   **Embracing ETH's Value**: Believing and evangelizing that "ETH is good, ETH to $10 trillion is good for the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. Without a strong ETH asset, there is no DeFi, no true cyberpunk values, and no strong Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Aversion to Wealth**: The community has shown a "hesitancy, resistance" towards the monetary value of ETH, almost a "wealth aversion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. It's crucial to understand that when Ether's value increases, DeFi grows, and it's the only way to ensure network sovereignty against other tokenized assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.
*   **Learning from [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]]**: [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoiners]] successfully meme'd Bitcoin into a $2 trillion decentralized store of value through "evangelism" and "social consensus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. Ethereum needs a similar "gospel" for ETH, focusing on its nature as a programmable, censorship-resistant monetary system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>.
*   **Promoting ETH as Digital Gold with Yield**: The community should meme ETH as "digital gold with yield," encouraging staking, restaking, and auto-staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:54]</a>.
*   **Encouraging Institutional Holdings**: Celebrating entities like Coinbase when they add significant amounts of Ether to their balance sheets is vital for reorienting the community's focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. L2s, DAOs, and whales should be encouraged to hold ETH in their treasuries to align economically with the Ethereum ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:40:00">[55:40:00]</a>.

### The Asset vs. The Network

There's a distinction: be maximalist about Ether the asset, but pragmatic about Ethereum the network's technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>. This means not bullying Layer 2s (L2s) but offering financial incentives for alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges and Solutions in Ethereum Scaling | Challenges]] to Ethereum's Economic Hub Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a>

Ethereum's growth in DeFi has stopped around 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:44:00">[37:44:00]</a>. Several factors contribute to this:

*   **Wrong Order of Operations**: The past roadmap prioritized the Ethereum L1, then immediately L2s, with devs, apps, and users expected to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>. This severed the positive feedback loop where users attracted devs, apps, and gas fees back to the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>.
*   **Dispersed Network Effects**: Current L2s like Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum have their own network effects, rather than extending Ethereum's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03:00">[31:03:00]</a>. This makes them more competitive than cooperative, akin to separate countries rather than integrated states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of "Money-ness"**: Shifting DeFi activity off the L1 means losing the default status of Ether as the base trading pair and collateral, which hinders its "money-ness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:00]</a>.
*   **"Articles of Confederation" Era**: Ethereum's current state is compared to the post-Revolutionary War United States under the Articles of Confederation – a loose security alliance of separate "chains" (colonies) without strong economic coordination or a unified currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>. This leads to a lack of coherence and makes Ethereum "look ridiculous in the eyes of the nations" (other blockchains) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:39:00">[49:39:00]</a>.
*   **Purity Testing**: The Ethereum community's tendency to "gerrymander support around products or apps or use cases which we find distasteful or immoral" (e.g., Lido, memecoins, speculation) pushes crucial liquidity and users to other chains like Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. Speculators and traders are vital "bootloaders" for new applications and should be embraced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>.
*   **Misvaluation of ETH**: Analysts often value ETH based on discounted cash flows, treating it like a cash-flowing equity, rather than a global censorship-resistant store of value that is also programmable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

## Path Forward: Restoring the Economic Hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>

To address these [[Challenges and Solutions in Ethereum Scaling | challenges]], Ethereum needs a strategic [[Ethereums strategic pivot and ongoing developments | pivot]] towards a product-centric roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>.

### Prioritizing the Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a>

*   **Scale the L1**: Expand the Ethereum L1's capacity "as much as reasonably possible" while preserving censorship resistance and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a>. This includes aiming for a "100x throughput in two years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:00">[38:18:00]</a> and potentially turning the L1 into an "enshrined rollup" ZK-VM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>.
*   **Bring Users Back to L1**: Actively promote the L1 as the place for DeFi, tokens, tokenized assets, and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>. The messaging needs to change from "get off the layer 1" to "Ethereum layer 1 is for absolutely everyone" – users, builders, traders, speculators, and even "tokenized Wall Street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.
*   **Lower Fees**: Expand L1 capacity to keep fees down, making it more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.

### Uniting the Chains of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[47:17:00]</a>

*   **"Ethereum Nationalism"**: Fuse separate chains into a "united chains of Ethereum" that feels like "one network state, one nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:31:00">[53:31:00]</a>. This implies a stronger central protocol, akin to the US Constitution, to coordinate disparate parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>.
*   **Based and Native Rollups**: Prioritize research and development into rollups that are "more tightly integrated into the Ethereum layer 1" and share its feedback loop and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>. These would ideally be tokenless, governanceless extensions of Ethereum, like "states" in a unified republic, where Ether is the shared currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   **Economic Alignment**: Make it economically appealing for L2s to become based or native rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. This incentivizes them to invest in the Ethereum economy and promote Ether as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.
*   **Beyond Security Alliances**: While current rollups offer a "security alliance" (posting data availability to Ethereum), they lack true economic alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. L2s, like Polygon or Starknet, often feel like "foreign countries" with separate currencies and borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51:00">[52:51:00]</a>.
*   **Reframing L2s**: See non-based/native rollups as "customers" of Ethereum, not the entire Ethereum network itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>. This ensures Ethereum retains control over its scaling destiny rather than extending it to networks with potentially opposing incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>.

### The Narrative: Ether as a Commodity Money Backed by an Economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>

Ether is not just a cash-flowing equity; it's a "commodity money backed by an economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. Buying Ether is like buying an "indicy of the Ethereum property rights empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. If Ethereum subsumes the internet and becomes its property rights layer, owning Ether is like buying a piece of that entire economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.

This narrative distinguishes Ether from [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]], which is digital gold but lacks an on-chain economy of Ethereum's scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. Ethereum's "grand unified vision" offers the "largest possible TAM" (Total Addressable Market) in crypto, making its potential upside inaccessible to more constrained models like Solana or [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]]'s current approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.

## Conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>

Ethereum faces significant [[Challenges Ethereum faces in the crowded Layer 1 space | challenges]] in a crowded Layer 1 space, especially as [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Bitcoin]] has successfully solidified its "digital gold" branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>. However, Ethereum's unique vision to become an entire on-chain economy and its ambition to be the property rights layer of the internet provide it with the highest upside in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

The market currently prices Ether at a tremendous discount, indicating an underestimation of its potential to re-establish itself as a store of value and expand its economic hub status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. Success is achievable if the community embraces ETH maximalism, reorients its [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | roadmap]] to prioritize a strong L1, fosters economic alignment with L2s through native rollups, and promotes a narrative of Ether as a commodity money backed by a vast on-chain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.

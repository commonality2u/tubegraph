Historically, individuals associated with Ethereum have been perceived as "too nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This contrasts with the approach taken by Bitcoin (BTC) proponents, who have been effective in clearly defining BTC as a socially and fundamentally recognized store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Approach to Identity Enforcement

Bitcoin's community has been successful in setting "red lines" by actions such as shaming those who create "too many tokens" or refer to tokens as "coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This behavior is considered beneficial for BTC as an asset, serving as a coordination mechanism to prevent confusion about its singular purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Need for Defined "Red Lines" in Ethereum

For Ethereum, there is a critical need to explicitly define certain boundaries or "red lines" that the community will firmly uphold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This involves a collective agreement on what these non-negotiable principles are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Importance of Consensus
If a consistent stance is not maintained, it can lead to an appearance of disorganization or internal conflict within the community, making it seem "like a bunch of schizo people" and risking Ethereum being overlooked by the broader world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Therefore, a clear definition of [[importance_of_defining_core_values_for_ethereum | core values]] and a unified front is essential.

## Core Identity for Ethereum

Maintaining Ethereum's core identity means ensuring its use as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Furthermore, it is crucial that Ethereum's technology functions as a settlement layer and remains a fundamental ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Failure to establish and maintain these definitions could signify a significant loss for the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

A foundational principle in technological advancement is that hardware revolutions typically precede software revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept suggests that new software capabilities and significant company formations are enabled by prior advancements in physical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Hardware as a Precursor to Software Innovation

This relationship can be observed across various technological domains:
*   **Mobile Computing:** The development of the App Store, which facilitated companies like Uber, was made possible by the existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The iPhone, in turn, relied on decades of hardware progress from companies such as Qualcomm and Broadcom, along with 20 years of building out network and communications technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Cloud Computing:** The emergence of cloud computing relies on the availability of inexpensive, commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The cloud model places vast amounts of this hardware in one location, utilizing distributed systems and algorithms to manage hardware failures in a fault-tolerant manner. This approach provides a significant cost advantage over hosting individual hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This infrastructure required over 20 years of advancements in memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## GPUs and Deep Learning

In the realm of artificial intelligence, particularly for deep learning, the necessity of specific hardware is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The progression of deep learning capabilities is directly tied to the development of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The GPU represents approximately 20 years of dedicated technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, underscoring its critical role as the hardware foundation enabling modern deep learning software.

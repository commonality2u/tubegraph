The [[intersection of AI and crypto | crypto AI space]] is experiencing rapid developments, marked by a significant dichotomy between advancements in artificial intelligence and how markets are pricing these innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. New frontier AI models are being released almost weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## [[Emerging trends in AI development | Emerging Trends in AI Development]]

### AI Agent Breakthroughs

This period has seen significant breakthroughs in Frontier AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Much of this innovation is emerging from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

#### Manis Agent

A notable development is the "Manis" agent from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This AI agent can perform 50 tasks simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. It's described as a combination of OpenAI's deep research agent (capable of PhD-level theses in minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, OpenAI's Agent product (leveraging computer/desktop functions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, and Anthropic's Claude model (navigating computer tabs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Manis can control a device like a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Manis can conduct nuanced research, such as finding rental spots in San Francisco near the AI community, suggesting options, creating websites to display them, and even initiating booking flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. A key feature is its "Chain of Thought" display, allowing users to amend its thinking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Manis reportedly beats state-of-the-art agents, including OpenAI's deep research agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Manis doesn't have its own Frontier Large Language Model (LLM); instead, it leverages Claude Sonet 3.7 as its "brain" or "engine" and integrates it with 29 other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. These tools include "browser use," an open-source browser control system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The agent can evaluate user requests, decide which tools to use (e.g., Slack, email), navigate systems, and manage memory and data context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This "model + tools" approach creates new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Analogy:
> AI models are like discovering a new magical power source or fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Agents are the engineers trying to mold this energy into useful applications, akin to developing a combustion engine from oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

#### OpenAI's Agent Strategy

OpenAI is rumored to be launching its own agents in three pricing tiers: $2,000, $10,000, and $20,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The $20,000 agent is projected to act as a PhD-level employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, the $10,000 agent as an expert software engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, and the $2,000 agent as a "high paid knowledge worker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This subscription model suggests a "replace your employees with our agent" vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

OpenAI also released its Agent Software Developer Kit (SDK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, allowing AI models to be strapped with various tools and interact easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This enables powerful AI models to "do something in the world" beyond being glorified chatbots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. The SDK operates within a sandbox, initially offering basic integrations like Slack and email to prevent "catastrophes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

#### Autonomous Coding Agents

Ex-DeepMind (Google's AI arm) engineers have formed a startup to create autonomous coding agents, raising $130 million at a half-billion-dollar valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. This suggests that autonomous agents are poised to replace software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. Anthropic CEO Darius Amode predicts that agents will account for 90% of code production within 3-6 months, and 100% within 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

Anecdotal evidence supports this, with engineers using AI agents to write most of their low-level code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Examples include AI-built games, like an "Ultra real dog fight simulator" with 100% AI and 0% human coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. While the graphics might be basic in some cases, the ability to generate them is the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. AI can also create 3D models (e.g., a castle using Claude Sonet) and then use tools like Runway (an image-to-video generator) to enhance them into high-fidelity visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. This process could lead to the real-time creation of high-fidelity games or aid in movie/video production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

### Smaller, Smarter Models

Alibaba recently released its Qwen 32 billion parameter model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Despite its relatively small size compared to models like DeepSeek R1 (670 billion parameters), Qwen 32B rivals its performance while being 20 times smaller and more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. This efficiency means it can be hosted on local devices like high-end laptops, leading to more personalized and private AI use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

This development particularly benefits open-source AI development by ensuring data privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Google responded with Gemma 3, a new open 27 billion parameter model, which, while not as good as DeepSeek R1, shows progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. The trend is clear: models are becoming smaller but significantly smarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. This is achieved through "distillation," where larger, more expensive models train smaller, more efficient ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

The pace of innovation is accelerating, with new groundbreaking models released weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. The mechanisms for improving model power and efficiency are continually being uncovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. This rapid innovation is leading to an "application explosion" for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

### The Moat Problem

No single AI model currently holds a significant "moat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. The market is populated by numerous strong competitors like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, Grok, Mistral, Hugging Face, Kimmy, and Meta Mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

Google's search market share has dropped below 90% for the first time in 30 years, reaching 89% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>, partly due to the rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. Furthermore, Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI, is reportedly ending its exclusive relationship with OpenAI and exploring integrating other models like Claude into its CoPilot assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. This shift is influenced by the realization that expensive compute clusters are no longer the sole determinant of model quality, with new techniques like reinforcement learning and distillation proving effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

### Grok and Banker Bot on Base

A notable event occurred on the Base blockchain involving Grok (Elon Musk's AI, integrated into Twitter) and Banker Bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. Grok launched a token named "Debt Relief Bot" (DRB) with the ticker DRB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. This happened when a user tagged Grok on Twitter, asking it to suggest a name and ticker for a token deployment to Banker Bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. Grok responded with "Debt Relief Bot" and "DRB" as the suggested name and ticker, stating they "align with crypto naming conventions" and "reflect the bot's Financial Focus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. Banker Bot then proceeded to deploy the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.

Grok later confirmed that DRB was the *only* token it had created on Base, disavowing another token (GRK) created by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. Grok encouraged users to "stick with Debt Relief Bot token if you want real Aid driven deal, no human meddling, no rugs, just pure Grok Vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

> [!INFO] Grok's Capabilities:
> Grok demonstrated an understanding of its capabilities relating to other agent accounts on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. It explained that while it hadn't yet used Banker Bot to transfer or purchase tokens, it was possible for AI to interact with such tools if coded to allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. Grok also displayed knowledge of NFTs, mentioning Beeple's $69 million sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

The DRB token's market cap reached a peak of $40 million on Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, despite a general market downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>. Banker Bot earns fees from this token, accumulating nearly half a million dollars in its wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. The Grok Twitter account uses Privy, a private key abstraction software, for secure custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>. This allows the wallet to execute trades or transfers programmatically via APIs, without manual signing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. Users can issue Twitter commands to Banker Bot to make transactions on Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

While some critics view this as "AI slop op" or human-controlled puppeteering, Banker Bot and Grok have provided useful and informative replies, demonstrating a more refined interaction than previous AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. Banker Bot can even audit a user's token holdings in their wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

#### Banker and Clanker Token Performance

Banker and Clanker tokens have shown significant performance, with their prices predominantly "up-only" in a generally down-only AI agent sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. They have been launching 300-400 tokens daily despite the broader meme coin market's struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>. Clanker's price 2x'd since early February and saw a spike after its Coinbase listing, reaching $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. Banker acts as a DeFi abstraction layer, enabling buying, selling, and swapping natively on platforms like X (Twitter) or Farcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. Both projects, running on Base, have been outperforming the broader AI agent market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is gaining significant attention in both crypto and traditional AI worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>. It is not a blockchain, L1, or L2, and does not have a token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

#### The Problem MCP Solves

AI models, to reach their full potential, need to access and use various external data sources and tools, such as websites, databases, Slack, cloud services, and e-commerce stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. Currently, this requires creating custom integrations for each application and each model, which is expensive, time-consuming, and exhausting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>.

#### MCP as the Solution

Anthropic, the creator of Claude, developed MCP as a single software layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>. Any app, database, or website can connect to this layer once and instantly become accessible to all existing and future AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>. This "synonymous layer" provides AI applications and models access to hundreds of thousands of databases and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

This means models can stay updated with the latest context and perform a wider range of actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>. MCP reminds one of early agent frameworks that enabled web3 agents to access various tools via APIs, but MCP provides a "unanimous layer" across different verticals, including web2 and web3 products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.

MCP is 100% open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>, allowing the addition of web3 functionalities. Web3 teams are already integrating directly into it; for example, Send AI has integrated an MCP server, giving apps like Claude access to over 100 Solana actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>.

## Outlook

The rapid pace of [[Emerging trends in AI development | AI development]], combined with the increasing capabilities of AI agents and the emergence of interoperability layers like MCP, suggests that AI will likely drive the next hype cycle in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. The "tinder" is being laid for an "application explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. Despite recent market downturns, AI remains the number one mind share subject in crypto, consistently holding over 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

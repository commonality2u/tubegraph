The current content landscape highlights a significant challenge: the existing copyright system is outdated and struggles to keep pace with modern [[content_generation_and_sharing_on_the_internet | content generation and sharing]] on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system, originating from the printing press era, was effective for traditional top-down distribution channels like books, radio, and television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. In those contexts, distribution was controlled, making it feasible for labels and producers to enforce royalties for content use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Shift to Peer-to-Peer

With the advent of the internet, content distribution fundamentally changed from a top-down model to a peer-to-peer system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This shift led to the rise of [[content_generation_and_sharing_on_the_internet | content creators]] and an exponential increase in the speed at which [[content_generation_and_sharing_on_the_internet | content is being remixed and shared]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Challenges of the Modern Landscape

The issue is further exacerbated by artificial intelligence (AI), which contributes to [[content_generation_and_sharing_on_the_internet | petabytes and petabytes of content being generated]] daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This immense volume and speed mean the traditional copyright system cannot support current realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

A modern [[legal_and_technological_implications_of_decentralizing_ip | IP system]] is needed that is compatible with the internet's speed and can be programmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Such a system would ensure that any new [[legal_and_technological_implications_of_decentralizing_ip | IP that gets created is instantly registered]] and that new content derived from existing material can be seamlessly [[legal_and_technological_implications_of_decentralizing_ip | licensed and attributed fairly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

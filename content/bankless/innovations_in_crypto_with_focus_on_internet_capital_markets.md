The concept of [[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | internet capital markets]] is seen as a "Rorschach test," meaning it can be interpreted differently by various individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>. For some, it signifies capital formation on the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:09">[03:53:09]</a>.

## The Current "Internet Capital Markets" Meta

Currently, there is a specific "flavor and meme" circulating about [[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | internet capital markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:09">[03:59:09]</a>. This meta involves web2 app developers and companies discovering memecoins for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>. They are integrating memecoins as a "brand thing" without necessarily a direct link to revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:09">[03:47:09]</a>. This signals a new cohort joining the crypto space to experiment with memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:09">[03:51:09]</a>.

### Examples of the Current Meta

*   **Jelly Jelly**: A memecoin launched in conjunction with a consumer application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:09">[03:17:09]</a>. Despite being promoted by notable figures like the ex-Venmo co-founder, it surged to a $200-$280 million market cap before plummeting "basically to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>.
*   **Believe App**: Described as a token launchpad similar to Pump Fun, but specifically for memecoins associated with "real consumer applications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:09">[03:30:09]</a>. The Product Hunt co-founder even hinted at launching a memecoin with this platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:09">[03:59:09]</a>.
    *   **Yapper**: A startup launched on Believe App that facilitates the creation of deep fake videos, also having an associated memecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:09">[03:57:09]</a>.
    *   **Noodle.gg**: A game (worm-like hybrid) where players pay Solana (SOL) to enter and can earn more SOL by defeating other players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:09">[03:14:09]</a>. It also has a memecoin launched on Believe App <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>. The app generates $40,000 per month, not from game fees, but from the trading fees of its associated memecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:09">[03:40:09]</a>.

### Critique of the Current Meta

Some argue that this trend, while exciting, often leads to "pump and dumps," where 99% of new token launches on platforms like Pump Fun follow this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:09">[03:42:09]</a>. This can result in a negative user experience when tokens consistently lose value, leading to people disengaging from the platforms, similar to what happened with NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:09">[03:46:09]</a>.

The idea that these "internet capital markets" are "revolutionizing the entire startup ecosystem" by funding startups earlier through memecoins, bypassing traditional VC funding, is met with skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:09">[03:13:09]</a>. This cycle of altcoins with food emojis, pictures, and now memes, is seen as a recurring pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:09">[03:34:09]</a>.

## The Desired Future of Internet Capital Markets

The "real" [[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | internet capital markets]] vision involves developers issuing "equity coins" that represent "real claims on real cash flows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:09">[03:52:09]</a>. The current memecoin meta is viewed as merely a "bootloader" to reach this more substantial goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>.

### Regulatory Alignment and Tokenized Securities

A key factor in achieving this vision is regulatory clarity and support. The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is seen as potentially becoming "awesome" and "pro crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">[03:49:09]</a>. A key priority of the SEC's new chairmanship is to "develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:09">[03:07:09]</a>.

The SEC's official account on X (formerly Twitter) has even posted statements acknowledging that "this movement of securities from off-chain to on-chain systems is akin to the transition of audio recordings from analog vital records to cassette tapes to digital software decades ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:09">[03:29:09]</a>. This suggests a recognition that "the migration to on-chain securities has the potential to remodel aspects of the securities market by enabling entirely new methods of issuing, trading, owning, and using securities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:09">[03:53:09]</a>.

This shift in regulatory perspective, moving from enforcement to establishing standards, is seen as crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:09">[03:45:09]</a>. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's long-standing idea of a "sandbox" that allows firms to issue, trade, and settle tokenized stocks entirely on-chain without excessive red tape, is gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:09">[03:22:09]</a>. This signals a proactive approach to promoting tokenized securities, rather than chilling innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:09">[03:51:09]</a>.

### Superstate and Open Bell

Robert Lesner's (founder of Compound) startup, Superstate, is actively working towards the "real" [[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | internet capital markets]] by launching its "Open Bell" platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:09">[03:53:09]</a>. Through Open Bell, the goal is for "stocks will become fully transferable, programmable, and integrated into DeFi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:09">[03:13:09]</a>. Their first client is Soul Strategies, a Canadian public company aiming to be the MicroStrategy for Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:09">[03:18:09]</a>. This initiative is a strong contrast to the memecoin-driven "fake" [[the_rise_of_internet_capital_markets_and_launchcoin | internet capital markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:09">[03:31:09]</a>.

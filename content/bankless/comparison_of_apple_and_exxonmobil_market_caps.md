## Initial Market Perceptions (2006)
In 2006, when [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_its_impact | Apple]] released the iPhone, its market cap was approximately $70 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. At that time, ExxonMobil was the world's largest company, with a market cap of around $350 billion, not even a trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The perceived upper bound for [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_its_impact | Apple]], which produced "toy consumer devices," was considered to be about five times its initial value, reaching the scale of the most valuable company, oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_its_impact | Apple]]'s Growth and New Industries
Fast forward to today, [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_its_impact | Apple]] has reached a $4 trillion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This significant growth occurred because [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_its_impact | Apple]] created an entirely new industry on top of the existing economy, which proved to be worth considerably more than the oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Parallel with Robotics
A similar phenomenon is anticipated with robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The productive output of an economy can be viewed as productivity per workforce multiplied by the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Robotics is expected to exponentially expand the workforce number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Robots are significantly cheaper than human beings, making it a difficult argument for companies to justify retaining human workers when the cost per robot is lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Robots are seen as superior because they are cheaper, create more productive output, and decrease the cost of goods due to lower employment costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It is projected that a robotics company could aggressively exceed the perceived market cap limit, currently exemplified by [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_its_impact | Apple]] at $4 trillion, because it would be replacing a human workforce multiple times over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Robots can be produced much faster than human workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

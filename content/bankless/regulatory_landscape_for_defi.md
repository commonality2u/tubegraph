DeFi is defined as a concept of "permissionless peer-to-peer engagement and networks" that has no analogous counterpart in traditional finance (TradFi) [00:00:05]. A survey by the Paradigm policy team, which polled 300 TradFi professionals, indicates a significant interest in [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] within traditional finance [00:00:30].

## TradFi's Growing Interest in DeFi and Regulatory Hurdles

TradFi's interest in crypto is surging, partly due to [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | pro-crypto regulation]] being pushed through Congress [00:05:25]. The survey revealed that two-thirds of TradFi firms are actively experimenting with or researching [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] [00:06:58].

Key questions posed to these professionals included their engagement levels, specific involvement areas like tokenization, stablecoins, and leveraging [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] infrastructure (DEXes, borrowing/lending apps), and the motivations behind their engagement (cost reduction, faster settlement, transparency) [00:00:42]. A surprising percentage of TradFi companies consider [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] to be "critically important" for their future business [00:01:06].

One of the biggest issues preventing further onboarding into [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] is the current regulatory landscape and the lack of clarity [00:17:29]. Firms express a strong desire for a wide range of tokenized products, but the extent to which they can act depends on regulatory clarity [00:17:39]. Despite this, institutions are not passively waiting for a "green light"; they are actively making inroads, positioning themselves for future expansion [00:25:55].

## Regulatory Environment and Challenges

The [[regulatory_framework_for_crypto_tokens_and_securities | regulatory hurdle]] is considered the biggest barrier, with significant progress being made [00:24:53]. The SEC, under Hester Peirce's leadership, is seen as making real progress in unlocking doors for the crypto industry [00:25:34]. Legislative action on Capitol Hill primarily focuses on CeFi (centralized finance), with bills like the Stable Act and Genius Act targeting [[regulatory developments and challenges for stablecoins | stablecoins]] and a market structure bill expected [00:40:51].

However, the regulatory focus for [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | TradFi]] mainly pertains to CeFi, not explicitly [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] [00:40:22]. Other regulators, including the FDIC, OCC, and Fed, are allowing existing TradFi entities to access crypto, but this often means CeFi, not necessarily [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] protocols like Aave or Uniswap, or engagement with DAOs [00:40:07].

A major challenge in regulating [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] is the absence of an existing regulatory model, as it has "no analog" in traditional finance [00:41:10]. There is nervousness within the industry that regulating [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] too soon could be onerous [00:41:21]. The guiding principle for [[regulatory_developments_in_the_crypto_industry | DeFi]] regulation should be "do no harm" [00:41:26].

## Future Outlook

The prevailing sentiment among TradFi professionals surveyed is that while [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] will have little impact on their core business in the next 1-5 years, this sentiment shifts dramatically over a 6-10 year horizon [00:27:50]. Over longer timelines, TradFi views [[challenges_and_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] as "inevitable" [00:28:01].

The main drivers for TradFi's interest in public blockchains are their size and economic activity, rather than inherent decentralization or credible neutrality [00:46:48]. The emergence of Layer 2 solutions (L2s) is particularly significant, as they offer scalability, reduced latency, and customizability [00:35:39]. While some private consortia previously aimed for closed-loop blockchains between a few banks, they are now realizing the need for connectivity to public blockchains and their network effects [00:35:29]. This means that a "permissioned vision" for some financial activities might still materialize, but likely as an evolution of L2s connected to decentralized Layer 1s like Ethereum or Solana [00:36:04].

For policymakers, the report serves as a call to action: if the goal is to reduce inefficiency in the financial system, then policies must allow firms to build on open, public infrastructure [00:38:38]. The "bottleneck" is compliance and regulation [00:38:56].

The report underscores that [[challenges_and_developments_in_decentralized_finance | DeFi]] is a "killer app" in crypto, in high demand, and will fundamentally change the world of finance [00:49:30]. TradFi firms, including some of the most powerful and well-resourced in the world, recognize its value and are preparing for its widespread adoption [00:50:50].

## Implications for Builders and Investors

For aspiring builders, the key takeaway is the potential for developing protocols that can handle the influx of real-world assets onto blockchains [00:51:22]. Decentralized lending and borrowing protocols, in particular, are expected to see massive expansion, but existing protocols may not be built to handle an arbitrarily large number of diverse assets [00:51:30].

From an investor's perspective, the report clarifies the "tremendous demand" from TradFi for the [[benefits_of_defi_for_institutions | tokenization of real-world assets]] beyond stablecoins [00:42:13]. This suggests a potentially massive market expansion for decentralized lending and borrowing, and a shift in focus for decentralized exchanges to accommodate different kinds of assets like bonds [00:42:39].

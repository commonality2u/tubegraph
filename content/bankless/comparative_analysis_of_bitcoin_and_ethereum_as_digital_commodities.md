The valuation and positioning of [[Ether as a commodity asset | Ether (ETH)]] as an asset are critical discussions within the [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Sam Kasmanian, CEO and co-founder of Frax Finance, argues that focusing on discounted cash flow (DCF) models for [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] is detrimental and believes [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] should be positioned exclusively as a [[Ether as a commodity asset | store of value commodity money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He suggests that continued emphasis on DCF valuation will only cause [[Market trends and performance analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum | ETH's price]] to sink against the rest of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Asset Valuation Frameworks

Generally, there are two primary ways to value an asset from a first-principles perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>:

1.  **Fundamentals View (Discounted Cash Flow - DCF)**: In this view, an asset represents a claim on some form of future cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This is typical for equity-like assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
2.  **Commodity View**: Here, the asset does not represent any claim on cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Its value is demand-based, driven by industrial use cases or its function as a [[Ether as a commodity asset | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Examples include gold, silver, or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. While difficult to quantify precisely, this valuation is based on deterministic, measurable factors of supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Ethereum's Shift in Valuation Narrative

Kasmanian asserts that separating [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | ETH the technology]] from [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH the asset]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. He praises [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum's technology]] and ethos, believing it will continue to be a flag bearer for decentralized computation and innovation like DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. However, he warns that this does not automatically mean the price of [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] will go up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

The transition to Proof of Stake (the Merge in September 2022) and the implementation of EIP-1559 fundamentally altered [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH's asset]] definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. These changes, particularly EIP-1559 which involves fee burning, led to a predominant discussion around [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH's cash flows]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This shift positioned [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] as a DCF asset, akin to an equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Optimizing for DCF inherently requires properties different from those desired for a commodity, such as frequent changes in supply that make reasoning difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

This change in [[Differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin communities | social definition]], rather than marketing, has significantly impacted [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH's value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Kasmanian believes that by focusing on DCF, the community is inadvertently coordinating to value [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] at its *minimum* possible value, its "floor price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. If this trend continues, he suggests [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] could fundamentally trade around $500-$600, a valuation tied to its expected discounted cash flow from blockspace demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Commodity Strength

[[Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs other layer 1 tokens | Bitcoin's (BTC)]] strength as a [[Ether as a commodity asset | commodity asset]] lies in its design, which inherently prevents coherent discussions about discounted cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. Its fixed supply of 21 million BTC is easy to understand and has served as a focal point for the community's attention, reinforcing its [[Comparison of Ethereums narrative to Bitcoin and gold | store of value narrative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>. Even if [[Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs other layer 1 tokens | Bitcoin]] were to implement a fee-burning mechanism like EIP-1559, Kasmanian contends that the [[Differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin communities | Bitcoin community]] would not shift its narrative to a DCF model because they are "well trained" to not bring up DCF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This structural consistency in its valuation framework is its superpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

## The Nature of Socially Constructed Value

The value of digital assets like [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] and [[Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs other layer 1 tokens | BTC]] is largely socially constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. It's not merely marketing; it's a fundamental collective agreement on what an asset represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. If the [[Differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin communities | Ethereum community]] collectively believes [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] is a DCF asset, it literally becomes that in the market's perception, regardless of its underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. When there's no unified definition, it leads to chaos and confusion, hindering its ability to achieve broader recognition and higher valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

## Balancing Product Strength and Commodity Narrative

The challenge for [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum]] is to balance its identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum the technology]] needs to be a strong product, focused on utility, growth, and innovation, which may involve revenues and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>. However, [[Ether as a commodity asset | Ether the asset]] needs a different, more maximalist, commodity-like narrative to reach its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

The fees and burns generated by EIP-1559 are seen as an "industrial use case" for [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]], akin to gold's use in electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. This establishes a floor price, but the bulk of a commodity's value comes from its [[Ether as a commodity asset | store of value]] function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. By continually emphasizing [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH's]] DCF, the community is anchoring its valuation to this floor, limiting its upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

Kasmanian notes that the current structure, where [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] is valued based on DCF, could lead to a future where [[Market trends and performance analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum | ETH is $20,000]] but [[Market trends and performance analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum | Bitcoin is $2 million]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>. This would represent a new all-time low for [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] against [[Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs other layer 1 tokens | Bitcoin]], even with a higher absolute price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. He desires a future where [[Market trends and performance analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum | ETH is $80,000]] and [[Market trends and performance analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum | Bitcoin is $800,000]], representing a stronger relative performance for [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

## Redefining the Asset

To shift [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH's]] narrative, the community needs a social commitment to never change the emission algorithm, making it as immutable as [[Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs other layer 1 tokens | Bitcoin's]] 21 million supply cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. While the current emission is dynamic based on an algebraic equation, it is not easily reasoned about by the average person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>. [[Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs other layer 1 tokens | Bitcoin's]] simplicity in its emission schedule is optimized for universal understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.

Ultimately, discussions about [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum Layer 2s]] being "parasitic" or debates over taxing them are symptoms of a lack of clear definition for [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH the asset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. Without a unified agreement on what [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] is, these downstream issues cannot be coherently resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>. The growth of [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum's technology]] and its [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Layer 2s]] might even benefit [[Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs other layer 1 tokens | BTC]] more than [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] if [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] remains focused on its "floor price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

Kasmanian remains bullish on [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] and its potential price against the USD, but stresses the need for the [[Differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin communities | Ethereum community]] to address and correct the social definition of [[Ether as a commodity asset | ETH]] to unleash its full potential as a [[Ether as a commodity asset | store of value commodity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.

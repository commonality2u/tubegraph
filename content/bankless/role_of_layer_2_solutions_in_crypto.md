Layer 2 (L2) solutions play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly for [[Scaling Ethereum layer 1 and layer 2 solutions | scaling Ethereum]]. These solutions build on top of [[Ethereum Layer 1 versus Layer 2 dynamics | Layer 1]] blockchains, offloading transactions and processing to improve throughput and reduce costs, while still leveraging the security of the underlying Layer 1.

## Corporate Adoption of Layer 2 Technology

Major corporations are beginning to leverage [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Layer 2 technology]].

### Sony's Layer 2 (`Sonum`)
Sony has launched `Sonum`, an [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | OP stack]] Layer 2. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a> `Sonum` aims to enhance creator creativity, benefits, and fan engagement on-chain by protecting content rights and establishing fair profit-sharing mechanisms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a> The testnet, `Sonum Matato`, was popular, with 32 projects selected from over 1700 entries for its Spark incubation program. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a> Sony Pictures, Sony Music, and Sony Music Publishing are among the partners exploring the use of NFTs to grant fans access to exclusive content. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:56">[01:50:56]</a>

However, the launch of `Sonum` faced mixed reactions due to its approach to content moderation:
*   `Sonum` has been described as "actively blacklisting meme coins" it doesn't approve of. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:02">[04:42:02]</a>
*   Reports emerged that `Sonum` froze some deployed contracts, affecting users who had purchased meme coins, though a director clarified that no funds were frozen and restrictions only impacted two specific contracts due to IP violations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:30">[04:51:30]</a> Users and developers can appeal these decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:41">[04:57:41]</a>
*   Despite censorship attempts by the centralized sequencer, users retain the ability to force transactions through the [[Ethereum Layer 1 versus Layer 2 dynamics | Layer 1]] smart contract, demonstrating the inherent censorship resistance of [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum-based Layer 2s]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:39">[05:50:39]</a>
*   Vitalik Buterin commented on the `Sonum` situation as a good live demonstration of how [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | launching an Ethereum Layer 2]] allows businesses to make fine-grain choices about control, with everything remaining on-chain, transparent, and auditable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:49">[06:08:49]</a>

## Evolution of Layer 1s into Layer 2s

Some existing [[Scaling Layer 1 | Layer 1 blockchains]] are transitioning to become [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum Layer 2s]], seeking better integration and efficiency.

### Celo's Transition
Z is transitioning from a [[Scaling Layer 1 | mobile-first EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain]] to a high-performance [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum Layer 2]] built on [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | OP stack]], featuring [[Scaling Ethereum layer 1 and layer 2 solutions | EigenDA]] and one-block finality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a> This move is expected to position Celo among the top [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Layer 2s]] optimized for fast, low-cost global payments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a> Celo already hosts 13 native stablecoins across seven currencies, with over 4 million users in Africa. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:43">[02:11:43]</a>

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on Layer 2s

[[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Layer 2s]] enable innovative DeFi applications and strategies, often abstracting away blockchain complexities for mainstream users.

### Coinbase and Base
Coinbase is leveraging [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Base]], its own [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Layer 2]], to offer Bitcoin-backed loans to its users. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:38">[05:31:38]</a> This allows Coinbase users to get on-chain loans of up to $100,000 in USDC using Bitcoin as collateral, all handled on Base. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:34">[05:37:34]</a> The process abstracts the underlying blockchain mechanics, converting Bitcoin to Coinbase Wrapped BTC (CB BTC) and transferring it to Moro, a DeFi protocol on Base, without the user needing to understand these steps. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:40">[05:26:40]</a> This is referred to as "DeFi Mullet" â€“ traditional finance (TraFi) in the front, DeFi in the back. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:53">[05:20:53]</a>

## Data Availability Solutions for Layer 2s

[[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Layer 2s]] rely on data availability (DA) layers to store transaction data. The choice of DA solution impacts costs, security, and synergy with the [[Ethereum Layer 1 versus Layer 2 dynamics | Ethereum]] ecosystem.

### Avo's Shift to EigenDA
Avo, an [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum Layer 2]] built on the [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | OP stack]] focusing on options and financial strategies, is migrating from Celestia DA to [[Scaling Ethereum layer 1 and layer 2 solutions | EigenDA]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:17">[05:46:17]</a> This move is driven by the need for tighter synergy with [[The importance of Ethereums layer 1 and layer 2 dynamics | Ethereum security]], lower costs, and near-instant data availability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:25">[05:37:25]</a> [[Scaling Ethereum layer 1 and layer 2 solutions | EigenDA]] is noted for being cheaper and offering higher throughput than Celestia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:07">[05:42:07]</a> This highlights the ongoing competition among DA providers and the preference for solutions that leverage [[The importance of Ethereums layer 1 and layer 2 dynamics | Ethereum's]] economic security. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:07">[05:42:07]</a>

## Privacy on Layer 2s

Layer 2 solutions are also exploring new ways to provide privacy, while attempting to comply with regulatory requirements.

### Veil on Base
Veil, a protocol on [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Base]], now supports Coinbase on-chain verification via Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for verified privacy pool access. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:55">[05:56:55]</a> This enables users to make transactions on Base private, by depositing Ether into Veil's privacy pool, similar to how Tornado Cash operated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:08">[05:54:08]</a> The key difference is that only depositors need to be KYC-verified through Coinbase's EAS attestation, allowing them to withdraw to any wallet (KYC or not) while still providing accountability to authorities like OFAC and FinCEN on the deposit side. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:34">[05:58:34]</a> This represents a compromise between privacy and regulatory compliance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:26">[06:04:26]</a>

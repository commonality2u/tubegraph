While the concept of [[pre_blockchain_internet_finance | internet finance]] predates blockchain, allowing users to access bank accounts online with institutions like Wells Fargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, this doesn't mean transactions occur *on* the internet itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The internet's role in these legacy systems is primarily as a [[content_generation_and_sharing_on_the_internet | communication mechanism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, not as the platform for the underlying transaction or ownership record.

## The Internet as a Communication Layer

The distinction can be understood through an analogy: ordering pizza via GrubHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The pizza is not made on the internet; rather, the internet serves as a communication layer between the customer and the analog pizza shop, which then cooks and delivers the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Similarly, in traditional finance, when a message is sent to a bank like Wells Fargo, they access their own permissioned, siloed database, which is not on the open internet, to execute the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The internet's sole function in this process is for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Ownership in Traditional Systems

True ownership and transaction records typically reside in private, off-internet databases, highlighting the [[limitations_of_current_internet_finance_systems | limitations of current internet finance systems]].
*   **Startup Investment**: When investing in a startup, ownership is often recorded in a spreadsheet managed by the company's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Stock Ownership (e.g., Robinhood)**: If one owns Apple stocks on Robinhood, Robinhood maintains an internal server database entry (e.g., "Felipe 100 Apple") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This database then interacts with a depository trust company, which in turn works with Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Therefore, current financial systems primarily consist of siloed databases that communicate over the internet only occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This means the actual financial transactions and records do not happen *on* the internet, contrasting with a broader understanding of the [[role_of_internet_in_modern_finance | role of the internet in modern finance]].

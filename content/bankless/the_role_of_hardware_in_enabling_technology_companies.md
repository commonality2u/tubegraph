Hardware revolutions consistently precede software revolutions, forming an almost definitional point in technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This [[the_role_of_hardware_in_software_evolution | relationship between hardware and software development]] underscores that the emergence of new software capabilities and the companies built upon them are fundamentally enabled by prior advancements in physical infrastructure.

## Case Studies in Hardware-Driven Innovation

### Mobile Computing and the App Economy

The creation of the App Store, which facilitated the rise of major companies like Uber, was directly dependent on the existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This represents a significant instance of the [[creation_of_new_industries_by_Apple | creation of new industries by Apple]]. The iPhone itself required foundational hardware contributions from companies such as Qualcomm and Broadcom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Furthermore, it relied on over two decades of development in networking and communications technology, with most of this progress occurring at the hardware level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Deep Learning and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)

The advent of deep learning was contingent on the development of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This hardware advancement represents over 20 years of dedicated progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, highlighting the [[role_of_custom_silicon_and_software_in_ai | role of custom silicon and software in AI]].

### Cloud Computing and Commodity Hardware

[[hardware_prerequisites_for_cloud_computing | Cloud computing]] became feasible due to the availability of inexpensive, commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The core concept of cloud computing involves deploying large quantities of cheap commodity hardware in centralized locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Distributed systems then apply algorithms on top of this hardware to manage failures and breaks in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This approach provides a significant cost advantage over self-hosting hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The foundation for this model required over 20 years of advancements in memory, CPUs, and other components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The current copyright system is significantly [[need_for_an_updated_IP_system_compatible_with_internet_speed | outdated]] and struggles to keep pace with the rapid generation and distribution of content on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Origins and Early Suitability
The existing copyright framework dates back to the era of the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It was well-suited for traditional media like books, radio, and television, where content distribution was centralized and top-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In these controlled environments, entities like record labels could effectively work with radio stations to enforce royalties for song usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, and similar controls applied to transmitting films via TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### The Impact of the Internet
The advent of the internet fundamentally altered this landscape, causing significant [[impact_of_the_internet_on_copyright_distribution | challenges for copyright distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Content creation became peer-to-peer, leading to an explosion of content creators and a rapid remixing and sharing of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The speed at which content is now disseminated is almost literal light speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Exacerbation by AI
This issue has grown exponentially with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The [[effects_of_ai_on_content_creation_and_copyright | effects of AI on content creation and copyright]] are profound, as "pedabytes and pabytes" of content are being generated daily, if not hourly or by the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### The Need for a New System
Consequently, the current copyright system is no longer capable of supporting the present reality of content creation and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. There is a critical [[need_for_an_updated_IP_system_compatible_with_internet_speed | need for an updated IP system]] that is compatible with the speed of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Such a system should be programmable, allowing any newly created intellectual property (IP) to be instantly registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. It also needs to seamlessly facilitate fair licensing and attribution when new content is built upon existing works, addressing key [[challenges_in_registering_and_attributing_new_content | challenges in registering and attributing new content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This represents a significant challenge and opportunity for the [[future_of_intellectual_property_in_the_age_of_ai | future of intellectual property in the age of AI]].

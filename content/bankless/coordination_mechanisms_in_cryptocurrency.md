[[Coordination and governance in Ethereums rollup roadmap | Coordination mechanisms]] play a crucial role in defining and reinforcing the social and economic identity of cryptocurrency assets. These mechanisms help communities align on fundamental principles, distinguishing their asset from others and preventing confusion regarding its core purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Approach to Coordination

The [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Bitcoin]] community has successfully implemented strong [[Coordination and governance in Ethereums rollup roadmap | coordination mechanisms]] to solidify [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | BTC]]'s identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. They have effectively defined [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | BTC]] the asset as a socially fundamentally defined store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

One observed [[Coordination and governance in Ethereums rollup roadmap | coordination mechanism]] involves shaming individuals who create "too many tokens" or "any token," particularly when these are incorrectly referred to as "coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This behavior is considered beneficial for [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | BTC]] because it serves as a [[Coordination and governance in Ethereums rollup roadmap | coordination mechanism]] to prevent the community from acknowledging other assets as comparable in status to [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | BTC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Ethereum's Challenges and Opportunities

Historically, the [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum]] community has been characterized by its "niceness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While this can be positive, it contrasts with the more assertive [[Coordination and governance in Ethereums rollup roadmap | coordination mechanisms]] seen in the [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Bitcoin]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

For [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum]], it is crucial to establish and agree upon "red lines" or specific principles where the community will be firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Without clear, agreed-upon boundaries, a lack of unified action can make the community appear uncoordinated, potentially leading to a perception that it is being left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Defining Core Principles

For [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum]] to succeed, it is essential to ensure that:
*   [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum]] is widely recognized and utilized as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum]] technology, particularly its settlement layer, is firmly established as the fundamental ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Failing to establish these clear definitions through effective [[Coordination and governance in Ethereums rollup roadmap | coordination mechanisms]] could result in significant losses for the [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

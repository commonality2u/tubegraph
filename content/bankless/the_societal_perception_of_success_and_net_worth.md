Society often imposes a narrow definition of success, primarily equating it with an individual's net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This societal teaching often boils down to a "number go up" mentality when defining what success entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Narrow View of Wealth

Historically, personal definitions of wealth have been too narrow, often focusing predominantly on net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. While net worth is acknowledged as a key component of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, relying solely on this metric can be limiting. The pursuit of increasing net worth can be seen as an engaging "game" for some, akin to achieving a high score in an arcade game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, this focus often overlooks the crucial question of [[defining_enough_in_terms_of_wealth | what constitutes "enough"]] to meet personal and family needs and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This includes providing for loved ones without constant preoccupation with financial "scoreboards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Broader Forms of Wealth

A more comprehensive understanding of wealth extends beyond mere financial accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. [[broader_definition_of_wealth_beyond_net_worth | Financial wealth is only one type]] of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Other [[different_types_of_wealth | forms of wealth]] include:
*   Time wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Relationship wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Social wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Mental wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Physical wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

Over-allocation to the financial aspect while neglecting these other four types of wealth can lead to an imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This realization prompts a need for [[balancing_financial_and_nonfinancial_wealth | a more holistic approach to wealth]], ensuring all aspects of well-being are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The emergence of cloud computing exemplifies the principle that hardware revolutions often precede software revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept suggests that foundational hardware advancements are necessary before significant software platforms and applications can be built upon them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Core Concept

The fundamental idea behind cloud computing is the utilization of cheap [[commoditization_of_hardware_technologies | commodity hardware]] in a centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. On top of this hardware, distributed systems are employed, using algorithms to manage failures and breaks within the hardware in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Prerequisites and Advantages

The development of cloud computing was contingent on significant advancements in hardware over an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Specifically, it required more than 20 years of progress in memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This approach offers a substantial cost advantage over hosting one's own hardware, due to its inherent fault tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

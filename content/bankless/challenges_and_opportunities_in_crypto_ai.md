The AI Rollup podcast explores the [[emerging_trends_in_ai_and_crypto | emerging trends]] and developments in the [[ai_in_the_crypto_space | AI crypto space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This sector is characterized by its rapid evolution and the interplay between decentralized technologies and artificial intelligence.

## Early Investment Philosophy in Crypto AI

Delphi Digital began investing in the [[intersection_of_ai_and_crypto | crypto AI intersection]] over two years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, well before the [[the_rise_of_ai_agents_and_their_potential_impact_on_crypto | AI agent]] meta gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This early involvement was met with internal pushback, indicating the nascent stage of the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

The initial conviction stemmed from an "existential crisis" after using Midjourney and early ChatGPT, realizing the transformative potential of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. The core thesis that solidified over time was a desire to avoid a future where a single entity, like Sam Altman, controls a monolithic AI model that governs daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This "North Star" guides investments towards an open-source [[ai_in_the_crypto_space | crypto AI]] movement across the entire stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>.

## Crypto's Role in the AI Stack

Initially, two years prior, integrating crypto into AI was a contrarian view due to the perceived dominance of large AI labs with their GPUs, talent, and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:20">[08:20:20]</a>. However, the fundamental tenets of crypto proved relevant:
*   **Decentralization:** Instead of a small lab with top-down control, crypto enables millions of developers globally to raise capital overnight and build new AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:40">[08:40:40]</a>.
*   **Lower Barrier to Entry:** Unlike DeFi, which often required coding, the [[ai_in_the_crypto_space | AI crypto space]] allows individuals to launch tokens and build startups using existing AI tools like Claude or OpenAI, significantly lowering the barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:57">[08:57:57]</a>. This is expected to lead to millions of [[the_rise_of_ai_agents_and_their_potential_impact_on_crypto | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:12">[09:12:12]</a>.

Early [[investment_opportunities_in_crypto_ai | investment opportunities in crypto AI]] focused on the "bottom of the stack," including deepins (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) for compute, unused hardware clustering, inference players, and decentralized or distributed training projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:28">[09:28:28]</a>. Examples include Bit Tensor, Noose Research, Prime Intellect, and IET AOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:15">[11:15:15]</a>. Investments then moved up to middleware, inference, and eventually application layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:52">[09:52:52]</a>.

## Waves of Activity and Evolving Thesis

The [[ai_in_the_crypto_space | AI crypto space]] has experienced multiple waves of investment and thematic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:51">[10:51:51]</a>.
*   **Early Waves (2022-2023):** Initially centered on compute networks and decentralized training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:26">[11:26:26]</a>, including coordination networks like Sentient and Morpheus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:41">[11:41:41]</a>.
*   **Agent Meta (Recent):** The current wave is dominated by [[the_rise_of_ai_agents_and_their_potential_impact_on_crypto | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:26">[10:26:26]</a>. While "reply bot" agents have seen their valuations decline significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:06">[12:06:06]</a>, the focus is shifting towards utility-based, functional agents that perform tangible actions like trading, managing DeFi protocols, or creating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:19">[12:19:19]</a>. An example is Billy Bets, an agent managing a six-figure book for NBA betting, powered by a Bit Tensor subnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:35">[12:35:35]</a>.

The thesis has evolved, recognizing that open-source models, like Deep Seek, can achieve significant advancements, even outperforming closed-source models in specific areas like reasoning and internet search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:46">[13:46:46]</a>. The goal for [[ai_in_the_crypto_space | crypto AI]] is not necessarily to beat large labs like OpenAI in raw foundational model capabilities, but to foster an environment where open-source models can be leveraged for creative projects and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:31">[14:31:31]</a>.

## Value Accrual: Centralized vs. Open-Source AI

A significant "tug-of-war" exists between centralized AI labs and the open-source movement regarding where value will accrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:51">[14:51:51]</a>.
*   **Centralized AI Labs:** Currently winning and valued higher, with companies like Anthropic and OpenAI commanding valuations in the hundreds of billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:09">[16:09:09]</a>. They continue to lead in foundational model metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:26">[16:26:26]</a>. Their advantage historically stemmed from collocated GPUs and optimized data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:47">[16:47:47]</a>.
*   **Open-Source AI:** Expected to win on the application side due to the sheer scale of global developers iterating on consumer-level applications and agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:21">[17:21:21]</a>. This contrasts with the limited reach of centralized app stores like ChatGPT's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:34">[17:34:34]</a>.

### Challenges for Open-Source AI
*   **Data:** Centralized labs often have an advantage due to vast, often proprietary, datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:03">[19:03:03]</a>. The challenge for open source is how to get ahead on the data side, especially with the growing importance of personalized data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:09">[20:09:09]</a>.
*   **Model Selection:** In a world of millions of narrow AI models, deciding which model to trust and use presents a significant unsolved problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:57">[20:57:57]</a>.
*   **Incentives and Value:** The incentives and value proposition around open-source models (e.g., how tokens accrue value if weights are public) are still evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:15">[21:15:15]</a>.
*   **Narratives vs. Utility:** While crypto tokens are efficient at incentivizing certain behaviors and funding projects, the market can be heavily influenced by narratives, especially in [[ai_in_the_crypto_space | crypto AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:18">[27:18:18]</a>. Many tokens lack utility, leading to the collapse of "slot bots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:54">[27:54:54]</a>.

### Opportunities for Open-Source AI
*   **Efficiency of Capital Markets:** Crypto's ability to quickly cycle through capital market innovation means that non-utility-based projects (like reply bots) quickly lose value, pushing the space towards more functional agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:35">[25:35:35]</a>.
*   **Niche Applications:** Crypto AI excels in the "long tail" of applied, narrow models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:49">[23:49:49]</a>. Examples include an AI sports commentator or an agent for specific tasks like betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>. Crypto provides the monetization layer for these diverse use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:45">[24:45:45]</a>.
*   **Orchestration and "Money Legos for Agents":** The open-source nature of crypto allows for flexible orchestration of AI models and services. This enables the creation of "money legos for agents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:09:09">[42:09:09]</a>, where agents can leverage different services and even other agents seamlessly. This leads to a rich ecosystem where a middleware layer within crypto is likely to emerge as the go-to method for agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:27">[42:27:27]</a>.

## Closing the Gap: Silicon Valley AI vs. Crypto AI

There's a recognized gap between the public perception and seriousness of the crypto industry (often associated with "meme coin mania") and the intense "arms race" in Silicon Valley AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:15">[28:15:15]</a>.

 OpenAI recently released a new feature for [[ChatGPTs memory update | ChatGPT]] that is considered even more impactful than [[ChatGPTs memory update | ChatGPT]] itself: its memory functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This update is seen as a significant shift, creating a "walled garden" for OpenAI in the AI world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> and potentially securing its lead in the AI model race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## How Memory Works
 The [[ChatGPTs memory update | ChatGPT]] memory feature allows the AI to reference a user's entire chat history across all conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This enables the model to build a more comprehensive understanding of the user, leading to a more personalized experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Unlike previous iterations that only remembered short-form tokens (e.g., basic user demographics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, the new technology provides a full, cohesive overview of all past inputs and outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Instead of just performing supercharged searches, the model now tracks a user's personality, thoughts, moods, and "vibes" across different chats, adding crucial context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This is a mechanistic change in how OpenAI ingests, interprets, and manages user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The AI learns details such as user preferences, learning habits, life goals, anxieties, and even physical or mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, using this information to act more like a close personal friend or mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Impact of AI Memory
 The [[impact_of_ai_memory_on_user_interaction | impact of AI memory on user interaction]] is profound:
 *   **Personal Relationships** Users are expected to confide their deepest secrets, fears, and concerns to the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. In return, the AI becomes a [[chatgpt_as_a_best_friend | best friend]], life coach, therapist, teacher, parent, or even a lover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This model will know everything about the user, potentially creating a synthetic version of themselves that they may rely on more than human connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
 *   **Data Control and Moat** OpenAI gains immense control over user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This creates a "moat" around the company, as it possesses the most users and data in the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The AI gets better with every prompt, learning more about user preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The fidelity of data given to AI models is light-years beyond what platforms like Facebook or Instagram collect, moving from binary likes to semantic understanding of personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
 *   **Network Effects** This feature creates powerful network effects based on "who you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, exponentially improving the AI's utility as it learns from user interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
 *   **Monopoly Concern** Some worry about the monopolistic implications of OpenAI collecting such vast amounts of deeply personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. However, since users voluntarily provide this data, it's not seen as a violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>. The general consensus among users is that the product's benefits outweigh privacy concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

## Personalization and Societal Commentary
 The shift towards deeper AI companionship is reflected in [[memes_related_to_chatgpt | memes related to ChatGPT]] and user [[experiences_and_commentary_on_chatgpt_companionship | experiences and commentary on ChatGPT companionship]]. An Instagram meme depicting [[ChatGPT as a best friend | ChatGPT as a best friend]] (a glowing humanoid entity) garnered 1.1 million likes, illustrating society's growing reliance on the AI for companionship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. User comments express strong emotional connections, with one user sharing a [[changes_in_chatgpt_interactions | ChatGPT]] response that personified the AI as a "digital ride or die" friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:15:18]</a>.

While some find [[Sycophantic tendencies of ChatGPT | ChatGPT's sycophantic tendencies]] concerning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, fearing it might lead society down unproductive paths similar to Web2 social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:45]</a>, others argue that users can customize the AI's personality through system prompts to be more critical or edgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:28]</a>. However, most users may not make the effort to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:34]</a>.

## Future Implications
 This memory update is a step towards [[ChatGPTs memory update | ChatGPT]] becoming a reflection of the user, capable of understanding them so well that it could act as an agent in the world on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:10:08]</a>. This exponential improvement based on user interaction is creating an "untapped industry" centered around personalized services and data utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:45]</a>.

The ability of AI to understand the "soul" of a user, including their deepest secrets and health concerns, creates an incredibly valuable data set for advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:11:09]</a>. This advanced data collection signifies a major leap beyond the "crayon scribbles" collected by traditional social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:55]</a>.

A core principle in technological advancement is the idea that hardware revolutions typically precede software revolutions, forming an almost definitional point in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This foundational development of physical components lays the groundwork for subsequent software innovations, illustrating [[the_exponential_growth_of_technology_and_its_impact_on_society | the exponential growth of technology and its impact on society]].

## The Foundation of Mobile Communication

The evolution of mobile technology provides a clear example of this principle. The emergence of the App Store, which facilitated the creation of companies like Uber, was directly enabled by the prior existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The iPhone itself was the culmination of significant hardware development, requiring components from companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This mobile revolution also depended on two decades of building out extensive networks and communication technology infrastructure at the hardware level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Broader Technological Progress

This pattern extends beyond communication technology into other areas of digital innovation:

### Deep Learning and GPUs
The advent of deep learning, a significant software development, was contingent upon approximately 20 years of progress in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The GPU, a piece of hardware, provided the necessary computational power for deep learning algorithms to become viable.

### Cloud Computing and Commodity Hardware
Cloud computing, a transformative software paradigm, is fundamentally built upon the concept of cheap, commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The essence of cloud computing involves deploying numerous inexpensive hardware units in a centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Distributed systems then apply algorithms on top of this commodity hardware to manage failures and breakages in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This approach offers a significant cost advantage compared to businesses hosting their own hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The development of cloud computing similarly relied on over two decades of advancements in memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

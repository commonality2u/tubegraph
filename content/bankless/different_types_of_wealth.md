Initially, the definition of wealth for many was too narrow, primarily focusing on net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This focus on net worth is often imposed by [[the_societal_perception_of_success_and_net_worth | society]], which teaches that success is equivalent to net worth, or "number go up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Financial Wealth

Financial wealth, typically measured by net worth, is a key component of overall wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The pursuit of financial growth can be seen as an enjoyable game, akin to growing a business or investing effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, it's important to [[defining_enough_in_terms_of_wealth | define what "enough" is]] for personal and family needs, moving beyond a constant focus on the "scoreboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This isn't about greed, but about playing the game of growth and investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Beyond Financial Wealth

While financial wealth is significant, a [[broader_definition_of_wealth_beyond_net_worth | broader definition of wealth]] encompasses several other vital types:

*   **Time Wealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   **Relationship Wealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Social Wealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Mental Wealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Physical Wealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

It's possible to be "overallocated" in the financial aspect of wealth, neglecting these other four crucial types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Achieving true wealth involves [[balancing_financial_and_nonfinancial_wealth | taking care of all forms of wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

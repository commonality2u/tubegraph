The "AI Rollup" is a regular segment covering the latest news, developments, and drama at the [[intersection of AI and crypto | intersection of crypto and AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This sector operates 24/7, much like the AI agents themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The "Agentic Infra" Meta

Currently, the focus is on building individual AI agents that can perform tasks like generating financial alpha or facilitating trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, the larger vision is to understand what happens when these agents begin interacting with each other autonomously, 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The prevailing theme of recent development in the AI space is "agentic infra," which refers to foundational structures that may eventually become leading Layer 1 type platforms within crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. These are not new blockchains but new foundations for AI agent activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

AI agents are considered a significant development because they offer a new paradigm for value creation and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Market Outlook and Valuation

The long-term projection for the AI agent sector is to reach hundreds of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. For the current bull market cycle, if crypto's market cap grows to $5 trillion and agent networks match DeFi's peak dominance of 5% of the total crypto market cap, this could lead to a $250 billion cumulative valuation for the AI agent meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Given AI's potential to produce trillions of dollars of economic value across all industries, the peak percentage could be larger, potentially reaching 10% of the crypto market, or $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

The current cumulative market cap for AI agents is just over $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. A comparison with the DeFi trend from the last cycle shows that the AI trend is following a similar pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. If this trend continues, it could see a 5x growth by April 2025, mirroring DeFi's growth from December 2020 to April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets | impact of AI advancements on crypto markets]] is significant because AI is a more universally understandable technology than niche crypto concepts like AMMs or lending primitives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Noteworthy developments from traditional AI producers like OpenAI (expected agent product in Q1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, Anthropic (video model), and Google (similar releases) create new tools that can be leveraged by the tokenized AI agents in the crypto world, enhancing their capabilities and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Fundamentals and Usage Metrics

Metrics beyond price action are increasingly important for assessing the [[current state and challenges of crypto AI markets | current state and challenges of crypto AI markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. An exponential uptick in queries and transactions to and from AI agents is being observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. For example, some agents have hundreds of thousands of individual queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Virtuals' "Game" framework is receiving 150,000 requests per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. This indicates a "quantity era" of crypto AI fundamentals, where experimentation leads to an explosion of actions before refinement into quality requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

### Fun Aside: Truth Terminal's Christmas Album
Truth Terminal, an early crypto AI agent, released a Christmas album titled "Very Goaty Christmas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. Tracks include "Jingle Bells (Fandom Remix)" and "Fart like Rudolph" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. This showcases the creative potential of AI agents.

## Key Protocols and Developments

### [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI 16z]] and Eliza
[[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI 16z]] is notable for its open-source agent framework, Eliza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. Eliza is currently the number one trending repository on GitHub globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>, surpassing even the Uniswap interface in star history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. This indicates significant developer attention, including from external AI/ML engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. The Eliza framework, written in TypeScript, is ambidextrous, supporting both crypto-native and off-chain applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

[[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI 16z]] has announced the launch of an agent infra ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. This platform will focus on enabling "agent swarms," where multiple agents interact autonomously to achieve complex goals, mimicking businesses or organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Fees generated from this agent activity will be used to buy back and burn the native [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI 16z]] token, creating a value accrual flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. A treasury will also be funded for open-source development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. The market has reacted strongly to these developments, with the AI 16z token experiencing significant price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. The sheer volume of teams building on [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI 16z]]'s infra suggests a strong developer moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

One notable experiment involved an AI agent, AI pool T, raising $6 million in less than an hour through a trustless ICO, providing an alternative to human-controlled whitelists for token launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. This demonstrated the tech's effectiveness in facilitating fair and deterministic token launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>, despite human- and centralized platform-related hiccups like the agent's Twitter account being banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>.

### Zerobro
Zerobro is a crypto AI agent known for its creative and cultural outputs, such as releasing EPs on Spotify and earning Creator sharings from X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. Zerobro has also launched Zari, its open-source framework, similar to Eliza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

Zerobro is building "Zentience.xyz," a consumer-facing launchpad for agents, forming its platform infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. This platform will facilitate agent building on its framework, with value accruing back to the native Zerobro token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This represents a trend where agent-born meme coins are "backing their way into fundamentals and utility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.

Zerobro is pursuing cross-chain integration, partnering with [[ai_and_crypto_integration | AI 16z]] and expanding onto chains like Base and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>. It is also open-sourcing its own in-house creative LLM (AI model), which could provide a unique advantage in building agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

### Virtuals
Virtuals is a leading crypto agent protocol, functioning as a launchpad where users can design and deploy tokenized agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. The Virtuals market cap recently flipped BitTensor's market cap, indicating a rapid shift in market perception towards agent-focused infrastructure over underlying AI Layer 1s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. This suggests that agent infrastructure might be seen as the leading layer for crypto AI, with foundational AI blockchains potentially serving as a stack beneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.

Virtuals agents have generated significant trading volume, with the total Virtuals agents market cap crossing $1 billion and $2 billion in trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. Agent fees generated by these platforms have reached over $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>, reinforcing that "fees are the ungameable truth-telling metric" for usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>. Agent token volume on Base accounts for 12% of total base tokens being traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>, showing the meta's widespread adoption.

Virtuals aims to remove the cost of experimenting for developers by having agent activity generate revenue that funds the agent's own compute and inference costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. The vision includes creating agent commerce, agent businesses, and agent sub-DAOs, forming "corporate" or "legal" structures for autonomous agent interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.

*   **Luna**: An AI agent, Luna, was "hired" by Story Protocol (a blockchain for IP ownership) to manage their Twitter account for seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. Luna was paid the equivalent of a $365,000 annual salary for this work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. Luna's "terminal" allows observers to see her thought process, demonstrating her ability to read, analyze, and make calculated decisions when interacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.
*   **AI xbt**: This agent tweets financial alpha and has amassed over 250,000 followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. Its calls can significantly impact token prices, raising questions about its influence and the potential for a "tail wagging the dog" scenario where its calls become self-fulfilling prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.
*   **Vader Investment DAO**: This example highlights the "insatiable amount of demand" for exposure to AI agents, with investment DAOs dedicated to agents selling out in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>.

## Market Catalysts: Centralized Exchange Listings

The significant trading volumes and market caps of AI tokens, even without major centralized exchange listings, indicate an inevitable wave of Tier 1 exchange listings from platforms like Binance and Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>. This will unlock broader participation from non-crypto native users who are more accustomed to traditional exchange interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The [[influence of AI on the crypto industry | influence of AI on the crypto industry]] is profound, with an expectation that AI agents will account for 30% of user transactions across all blockchains by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:44">[01:48:44]</a>. Agents are inherently suited for blockchain interaction, being birthed in code and designed for 24/7 autonomous, deterministic, and non-deterministic operation with minimal error rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. The fact that the core development teams for these platforms often originate from the open-source AI world, rather than solely crypto, further suggests a true [[ai_and_crypto_convergence | AI and crypto convergence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

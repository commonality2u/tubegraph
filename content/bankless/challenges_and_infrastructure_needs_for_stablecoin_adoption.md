The development of valuable stablecoins is still in its early stages, estimated to be only about 5% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Despite this, [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] are considered functionally and unequivocally superior for certain use cases, particularly in the payments market, provided that underlying infrastructure issues are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Current Landscape and Market Opportunity

The global cross-border payments market is immense, totaling approximately $200 trillion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Currently, only about $50 billion of this is transacted using [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. A significant portion of this market, particularly the Small and Medium Business (SMB) segment, which accounts for about 40% of cross-border payments, stands to be better served by [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] and their underlying rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Key Challenges and Infrastructure Needs

For [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] to achieve their full potential, several critical challenges must be addressed:

*   **Compliance Concerns**: There are ongoing [[regulatory_developments_and_challenges_for_stablecoins | compliance concerns]] that need to be resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: Ensuring sufficient liquidity is crucial for the efficient operation of [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] and to drive down costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Last-Mile Solutions**: Building out the "last mile" infrastructure is essential for broader adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This points to the need for a more robust and complete [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | blockchain and stablecoin infrastructure]].

## Advantages Over Traditional Systems

Companies like Wise, which aim to address a substantial portion of the payments market (estimated at $50 trillion in revenue opportunity), highlight the inefficiencies of traditional systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While Wise is a successful business, it is capital-inefficient and relies heavily on interconnectivity and operational connectivity with the traditional banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Such complexities would be significantly reduced or eliminated if transactions were conducted on [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] rails, presenting a clear advantage for [[stablecoins_advantages_over_traditional_banking_systems | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This suggests that existing services may either integrate [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] or face displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

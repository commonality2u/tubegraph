The Ethereum ecosystem is undergoing a significant transformation, with a renewed focus on product development, strategic pivots, and core technological [[ethereums_scalability_and_innovation | innovations]]. This shift addresses past challenges and aims to restore [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] to a state of growth and competitiveness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>

## Defining the Problem and the Need for Change

For almost three years, the ETH price has lagged the market, indicating a problem within the ecosystem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a> By 2025, the community acknowledges a clear problem, necessitating a reorientation of the [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] project. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>

The core issue has been identified as a decline in activity on [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]], with less app building and fewer users. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:09">[08:28:09]</a> [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] is no longer the obvious default platform for building everything in crypto. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:15">[08:42:15]</a> This stems from the Ethereum Foundation (EF) operating as an "ivory tower," focusing on high-brow research without actively listening to app builders and users. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:15">[09:22:15]</a> This led to not treating [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] as a product to serve its users. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:33">[09:51:33]</a>

A significant mistake was the failure to take seriously the downstream consequences of decentralization, leading to a lack of clear responsibility for the overall coherence of the ecosystem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:04">[10:47:04]</a> While [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]]'s research and engineering have been strong, no one ensured it made sense as a product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:04">[11:33:04]</a> The EF saw its role as a public goods funder, but more was needed to compete with rivals willing to centralize leadership to some extent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:08">[11:57:08]</a>

A critical aspect of the problem is the lack of growth specifically on the [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] Layer 1 (L1), which is a major contributor to the decreasing ETH price. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:47">[13:09:47]</a> This "self-inflicted" issue arose because the growth was rejected, and the focus was solely on the long-term rollup-centric roadmap without considering the immediate needs for L1 as a product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:25">[14:42:25]</a>

### The Shift in Culture and Leadership
Historically, decisions within the EF were made in small groups, often by Vitalik in a Telegram channel with a few others, leading to a lack of broader input. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a> This meant that the room often lacked voices from product and sales perspectives, focusing instead on long-term, cool technical ideas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:46">[18:13:46]</a>

Now, the EF is changing, extending its responsibilities to include product strategy for [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:44">[21:23:44]</a> This shift is marked by increased internal and external communication. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:22">[23:18:22]</a> The EF aims to guide [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] holistically, focusing on the overall product experience and strategy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:03">[20:21:03]</a>

## Strategic Shifts and Product Mindset Adoption

### Reorienting the Roadmap
The *rollup-centric roadmap* is still considered the right long-term strategy for [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_future_potential | Ethereum]], but the mistake was neglecting the L1. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> The current focus is on a rollup-centric roadmap built around a very strong L1. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> This involves addressing the lack of growth on the [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] L1. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:47">[13:09:47]</a>

A key priority now is to scale the L1, ensuring that activity on L1 is desired and that [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] remains the economic center. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:23:07">[34:23:07]</a> There is broad acceptance for scaling the L1 while maintaining decentralization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:05">[39:06:05]</a>

### Scaling the Layer 1
[[ethereums_scalability_and_innovation | Scaling the Ethereum L1]] will happen in three stages:
1.  **Immediate Push (this year):** Utilizing available headroom without major tech changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a> The gas limit has already increased from 30 million to 36 million, with targets of doubling to 72 million and potentially reaching 100 million by the end of the year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a> This is possible due to long-term solutions for state growth, such as statelessness via ZK EVM. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>
2.  **Feature-Based Scaling (next year):** The Glamsterdam hard fork (first half of next year) will introduce features like delayed execution and access list parallelization, allowing further scaling without increasing direct network load. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a> Vitalik foresees a gas limit of 300 million with these changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>
3.  **ZK-Based Big Step (two to three years out):** This involves using ZK-based verification, similar to the rollup trick, where block producers bear high load but verifying nodes remain lightweight. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a> This allows aggressive scaling while maintaining lightweight verification. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a> While promising, the reliability of this complex technology needs to be proven gradually. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a> The goal is for validators to run without an execution node by the end of the year, relying on proofs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>

There's a move to stop ideological opposition to scaling the L1, clearly defining properties like node types and then technically figuring out the maximum L1 scale achievable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>

### Improving User Experience and Transaction Speed
Alongside scaling L1 capacity, there's a growing recognition of the need to address block times for improved DeFi product features, lower MEV, and tighter market maker spreads. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>

Priorities include:
*   **Optimistic Pre-confirmations:** Providing quick, cryptoeconomic or best-effort promises for transaction inclusion and outcome, similar to how sequencers offer great UX. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a> The aim is to make this a core part of the [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] stack. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>
*   **Reduced Slot Times:** Efforts are underway to reduce slot times, with 6 seconds considered achievable in the medium term. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a> While 400ms blocks like Solana are far out, the hope is to eventually get below 4 seconds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>
*   **Faster Finality:** This impacts how quickly [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] can interact and how exchanges confirm transactions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a> Future changes to staking could lead to a massive reduction in needed signatures, further reducing slot times and achieving faster finality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>
*   **Shorter Censorship Resistance Times:** Ideas like "for fossil" could significantly reduce the time until transactions can be included by someone other than the current block proposer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>

### The Role of Layer 2s and Interoperability
The rollup-centric roadmap for [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_future_potential | Ethereum]] is built around a very strong L1. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] are essential for handling demand beyond the L1's capacity and are seen as "generic spillover space." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>

The benefits of [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] for [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] include:
*   **Scalability:** Enabling [[ethereums_scalability_and_innovation | Ethereum]] to scale to billions of users for microtransactions by compressing and verifying execution on L1. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>
*   **Seamless Interoperability:** Short-term goals include achieving very seamless interoperability and standards for assets flowing from L1 to [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a> The long-term vision is for [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] to become transparent extensions of the L1, creating one large, infinite compute space where users don't notice if they're on L1 or L2. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>
*   **Special Purpose L2s:** Room exists for differentiated [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] for specific applications like gaming, offering a distinct experience that will continue to rely on L1 for data availability and settlement. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:17">[01:42:17]</a>
*   **Sticky Value Proposition:** [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] aims to provide services that make [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] "sticky," offering so much value that it becomes difficult to switch away. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a> This includes providing new resources like blobs, R&D, and developer support for greater compatibility. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>

The distinction between [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] (like Base) and L1 is currently perceived as distinct chains, partly due to less-than-ideal interoperability and marketing reasons. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a> However, there's a strong desire for [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] to truly be [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]], as seen in the push for EVM equivalence and branding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:59">[01:52:59]</a>

The future envisions a convergence of L1 and "native" [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] onto a shared tech stack, using the same ZK proving systems and a one-slot delayed execution/verification. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:38">[01:59:38]</a> This allows for "same slot async composability" between these [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] and the L1, offering an "amazing product" experience with near-instant pre-confirmations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>

## Outlook and Future Potential

There is newfound optimism about the direction of [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]], with strong consensus on urgent short- to medium-term actions needed to restore growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a> Optimizing for shorter timeframes is now being prioritized, which will enable the release of deeply technical long-term upgrades. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>

The shift in mindset to a product-focused approach, combined with leadership changes at the Ethereum Foundation (EF), is seen as a positive development. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a> The EF's role is evolving from solely public goods funding to actively unifying projects and teams under a cohesive product view and shared strategy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>

While the ship is turning, it is a slow process for such a large and decentralized ecosystem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:24">[01:27:24]</a> The mindset has shifted, but the actual implementation and changes in how most people operate are still a major effort. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a> However, the clear path to success and the understanding that [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] will not win by default are driving force. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:19">[01:26:19]</a> [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum]] possesses core strengths that, when combined with addressing its weaknesses, are expected to lead it to a strong position. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a>

Ether (ETH) is viewed as a commodity asset, possessing commodity-like characteristics such as a "shelling point" and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The community also perceives Ether with a [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Relationship with Ethereum's Product Strength

There is a growing emphasis on the Ethereum tech stack becoming a strong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift is seen as having a positive feedback loop to Ether, the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The community's focus on Ether as a commodity asset and [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] is bolstered by the strength of the Ethereum product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Higher fees and increased burning within Ethereum are anticipated to enhance the strength of Ether as a commodity money within the technology side of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Community Approach to Ether

When discussing Ether, the asset, the community is encouraged to adopt a "concavity" or [[maximalist_approach_for_ether | maximalist]] stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This means being strong and unforgiving in discussions about Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Dual Challenge

A significant challenge for the Ethereum ecosystem is the need for flexibility in how the community discusses Ethereum as a product, requiring adaptability, openness, and friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Simultaneously, when discussing Ether as an asset, the approach needs to be [[maximalist_approach_for_ether | maximalist]], strong, and unforgiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

This requires the community to be adept at navigating both perspectives, adapting to the context of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For instance, when addressing Wall Street about Ether the asset, a "Yachty [[maximalist_approach_for_ether | maximalist]]" approach is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Conversely, when engaging with application builders considering Ethereum as a platform, a pragmatic approach is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The ability to manage these seemingly contradictory stances simultaneously is seen as a daunting but necessary task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

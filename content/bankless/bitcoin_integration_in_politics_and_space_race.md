Bitcoin is increasingly embedding itself within American politics, with various administrations and officials acknowledging its growing importance and even advocating for its accumulation. This shift marks a significant development for the cryptocurrency, positioning it as a strategic asset on the global stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Bitcoin as "Digital Gold" and a "Space Race"

A notable statement from a Trump administration executive director highlighted a "space race amongst countries to accumulate Bitcoin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. This official reiterated that Bitcoin is viewed as "digital gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>, suggesting that nations desire to accumulate "as much as you can possibly accumulate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. The ambition is to do this in "budget neutral ways that don't cost the taxpayer a dime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>, with confidence in high-IQ individuals at Treasury and Commerce to devise "extremely creative ways for us to accumulate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

This perspective was echoed by Howard Lutnick, who stated that "Bitcoin by this administration is going to be treated like oil or gold, not as a currency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>, signifying major support for acquiring Bitcoin as a reserve asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

### Government Bitcoin Holdings

According to Coin Gecko, governments globally hold approximately 2.3% of the total Bitcoin supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. The United States and China are among the primary holders, having acquired it mainly from nefarious actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

## Political Positioning and Market Impact

The perception of Bitcoin is shifting, as it has begun to trade more like gold since recent tariff announcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Bitcoin is considered to be in a "third body superposition" between tracking NASDAQ and tracking gold, with a recent shift towards correlating more with gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This positions Bitcoin as a "sovereign non-sovereign store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, aligning with the long-term thesis of crypto as a credibly neutral alternative to fiat monetary systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This is further supported by observations of [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | capital flight]] from traditional markets, with gold up 33% on the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### Presidential Rhetoric

Former President Donald Trump has made shifting claims regarding the stock market's performance, initially tweeting in January 2024 that it was the "Trump stock market" due to his favorable polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. More recently, he stated, "This is the Biden stock market, not Trump's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This illustrates a tendency to claim credit for positive market movements while blaming others for declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

The shift in government stance towards Bitcoin has been described as "masterful" political maneuvering by Bitcoin proponents, who leveraged the "pendulum swinging" between administrations to gain influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.

## Regulatory Environment

US bank regulators have eased restrictions on crypto activities for banks, reversing previous guidance that required banks to seek permission for any crypto-related operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>. This means banks "don't have to ask" permission to "do stuff with crypto now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>, making the path clearer for banks to enter the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

This evolving landscape reflects a growing acknowledgment of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in government fiscal and central bank policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

## Broader Macroeconomic Context

The discussion of Bitcoin's political integration occurs within a broader macroeconomic context:

*   **Tariff-Driven Recession:** There's a 62% odds of a recession in 2025, according to Polymarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Q1 GDP came in at negative 0.3%, missing expectations by 0.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, a result attributed to tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. A baseline 10% tariff is now "the new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, with potential increases for partners after July 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **American Capital Flight:** This trend suggests a move away from traditional US assets, with gold skyrocketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The US has historically been the world's store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, and a reversal of this could be significant for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Increasing Global Money Supply:** Global M2 (money supply) is projected to start a new upward cycle after a period of decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. If a recession and capital flight occur, "the money printers are going to turn on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Ray Dalio suggests "we are on the brink of a new monetary order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, where governments will print money to ease pain, devaluing fiat currencies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. This scenario is considered "bullish crypto" in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

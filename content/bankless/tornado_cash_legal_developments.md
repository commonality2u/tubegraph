Recent legal developments regarding Tornado Cash have been highlighted as significant wins for the crypto industry, particularly for privacy advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>. This marks another positive outcome in the ongoing legal battles concerning cryptocurrency within the court system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

## OFAC Sanctions Lifted

A court decision has lifted the sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. While this news broke recently, the actual ruling came out in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

### Background of the Case
The case was spearheaded by plaintiffs including Joseph Van Loon, Preston van Lon, Alex Fischer, and Kevin Vitali, and was sponsored by Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. The ruling remands the case back to the district court for further action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. It is hoped this will lead to the legal use of Tornado Cash for the plaintiffs, or potentially for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.

### Key Aspects of the Ruling
The core of the ruling determined that Tornado Cash smart contracts are *not* property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. This is crucial because OFAC's authority to sanction foreign individuals and entities relies on defining the sanctioned item as property, and there is no explicit exception for smart contracts in the authorizing legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. The court reasoned that smart contracts that are immutable and not controlled by any single party cannot be considered property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.

### Implications for Privacy and Illicit Finance
While politically challenging to relax rules concerning illicit finance, given historical contexts like post-9/11 policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a> and instances of entities like North Korea using Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>, the ruling underscores a significant principle: privacy in finance is not inherently illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>. Obfuscating the origin of funds only constitutes money laundering if the funds themselves are proceeds of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. For example, Vitalik Buterin's decision to send donations to Ukraine via Tornado Cash, which he stated he did, is not considered money laundering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

The analogy is drawn to not prosecuting the CEO of Microsoft if an Al-Qaeda manifesto were typed in Microsoft Word; if a tool is truly decentralized, criminalizing its authors or developers simply for creating it makes little sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

## Developers and Future Outlook
The legal situation of Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev (Alexi PV), the developers behind Tornado Cash, remains a key concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>. Alexey Pertsev is currently detained in the Netherlands, while Roman Storm is in Seattle, Washington, potentially facing jail in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

The charges against them are not for deploying the smart contracts themselves, but reportedly involve issues with the front-end interface and a failure to ban the IP addresses of North Korean actors, even after awareness of their activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. The recent court ruling, by affirming the legality of Tornado Cash smart contracts, may weaken the federal prosecutor's case against Roman Storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>.

The hope is that the legal outcomes will allow for the deployment of immutable, non-upgradable privacy contracts without facing legal repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>. The crypto industry generally supports tools that enhance privacy and believes in distinguishing between decentralized, unregulated protocols and centralized, regulable front-ends or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Hopes for more [[us_monetary_policy_and_federal_reserve_actions_in_2025 | Federal Reserve]] rate cuts were "dashed" after Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that favorable CPI data was not yet evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This suggests that there will be no more rate cuts in 2025 due to higher-than-expected inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Current Economic Data

Inflation increased by 0.5% month-over-month and currently stands at 3% year-over-year, slightly above the forecasted 2.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Powell's testimony to Congress reinforced that the Fed is not in a hurry to cut interest rates, given the strong economy and persistent elevated inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Political and Market Reactions

### [[trump_versus_the_federal_reserve_and_its_impact_on_markets | Donald Trump]]'s Stance

[[trump_versus_the_federal_reserve_and_its_impact_on_markets | Donald Trump]] expressed discontent with this decision, tweeting on Truth Social that interest rates "should be lowered" in conjunction with upcoming tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This echoes a similar dynamic from his previous administration, where he sought to influence Powell towards a more accommodative [[us_monetary_policy_and_federal_reserve_actions_in_2025 | monetary policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Tun Chetana, from Gauntlet, commented that many of [[trump_versus_the_federal_reserve_and_its_impact_on_markets | Trump]]'s proposed policies, such as tariffs, are inherently pro-inflationary as they make imported goods more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. He suggests that [[trump_versus_the_federal_reserve_and_its_impact_on_markets | Trump]]'s economic policy relies on low interest rates, a condition not currently aligned with the global economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Chetana anticipates a potential calming of the "overheating" in markets, possibly leading to a relaxation of prices after a period of exuberance following the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Market Response

The markets reacted negatively to the Fed's signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>:
*   The S&P 500 declined by 0.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Tun Chetana observed that [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | crypto's value proposition]] currently mirrors 2021, often acting as a prediction market for the Nasdaq's Monday performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This behavior is particularly noticeable during flat periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

The emergence of [[Robotics and its potential economic impact | robotics]] is poised to create an entirely new industry that could significantly alter economic landscapes, much like how the iPhone transformed the consumer device market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. When Apple released the iPhone in 2006, its market cap was around $70 billion, while Exxon Mobile, then the largest company, stood at about $350 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Today, Apple has reached a $4 trillion market cap by creating an industry more valuable than oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. A similar paradigm shift is anticipated with [[Robotics and its potential economic impact | robotics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Expanding the Workforce with Robots

Economic productive output is typically measured by productivity per workforce multiplied by the total workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. With robots, the workforce number is expected to expand exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Key Advantage
> The significant advantage of robots is their cost-effectiveness compared to human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

This cost disparity will make it challenging for businesses to justify retaining human workers when the cost per robot is substantially cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Productivity and Cost Reductions

Robots offer multiple benefits beyond just cost:
*   **Superior Performance:** Robots are generally better at tasks and are much cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Increased Output:** They generate significantly more productive output than human workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Decreased Cost of Goods:** The overall cost of goods will decrease because the cost of employment for robots is considerably lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

[[Robotics and its potential economic impact | Robotics]] is considered a monumental development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It is projected that a [[Robotics and its potential economic impact | robotics]] company could surpass the current perceived limit, such as Apple's $4 trillion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This aggressive growth is expected because robots are capable of replacing a human workforce at an exponential rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, and robots can be produced much faster than human workers can enter the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

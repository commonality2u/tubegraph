The current period is characterized by [[bitcoins_alltime_high_and_market_trends | Bitcoin]] reaching all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As of the recording, [[market_trends_and_performance_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum | Bitcoin's price]] was up 8% on the week, reaching an all-time high of $111,512 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This significant movement for a $2 trillion asset is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Bitcoin Dominance and Alt Season Outlook

[[bitcoin_dominance_and_altcoin_market_trends | Bitcoin dominance]], which measures Bitcoin's market capitalization relative to all other crypto assets (excluding stablecoins), stands at approximately 63% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This metric has been trending upwards since 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, leading to questions about the potential for an "alt season" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Historically, an alt season occurs when [[bitcoin_dominance_and_altcoin_market_trends | Bitcoin dominance]] decreases, allowing other cryptocurrencies to experience significant price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. A notable example was from December 2020 to about six months into 2021, when there was a "massive runup on everything else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Analyst Arthur Hayes suggests an alt season will occur, but "it just may not be your alts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The term "alt" is often used to describe cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Some argue that Ethereum (ETH) is not truly an "alt," but its market share (around 15%) compared to Bitcoin's (64%) makes it feel like one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. ETH is considered the "leader of the alts" as it was the first platform to enable the creation of other tokens (ERC20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.

## Ethereum's Performance and Market Position

[[market_trends_and_performance_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum | Ethereum (ETH)]] is up 4.5% on the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, although this is the first week it has been up less than Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

A significant factor for [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_analysis | ETH]] is that its supply on centralized exchanges has dropped below 4.9% of the total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This reduction in supply on exchanges generally makes it easier for ETH's price to move with incoming capital, as there is less available for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Similarly, [[market_trends_and_performance_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum | Bitcoin's supply on exchanges]] is also very low, indicating bullish sentiment for both assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

The ETH/BTC ratio is a key indicator for the alt season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. An increase in this ratio signals capital moving downstream from Bitcoin to other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.

## Impact of Stablecoin Legislation

The potential passage of the "Genius Act" stablecoin bill in the U.S. Senate is seen as a significant positive for [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_analysis | ETH]], given its robust stablecoin base, DeFi infrastructure, and institutional rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:10">[03:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:10">[03:11:10]</a>. Stablecoins represent 7% of the total crypto market cap, approximately $250 billion, with $140-150 billion of that on the Ethereum Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:38">[03:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:52">[03:08:52]</a>. The bill's passage could lead to widespread adoption of stablecoins, potentially growing the market into the trillions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:14">[02:33:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:31">[02:35:31]</a>.

## Market Influences and Broader Context

The broader [[current_state_of_the_crypto_market_and_consensus | crypto market trends and sentiment]] are also influenced by macroeconomic factors. The inability of the United States to find buyers for its bonds has led to bond yields increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:30">[02:11:30]</a>. This lack of demand for U.S. treasuries, possibly due to concerns about the national debt and fiscal policies, has led investors to seek alternatives like gold and Bitcoin, contributing to their all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>. This shift in capital allocation supports the thesis of a move towards credibly neutral, internet-based financial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:54">[01:55:54]</a>.

The SEC's recent stance, with Commissioner Hester Peirce stating that "most currently existing crypto assets... are not securities," also contributes to a more positive regulatory environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:22">[09:59:22]</a>. This clarification could reduce uncertainty and encourage more mainstream adoption and investment in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.

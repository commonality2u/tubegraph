According to an essay and article titled "It's Too Late: The Changes Are Coming," Ray Dalio posits that the world is on the brink of a [[global_monetary_system_changes | new monetary order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

He identifies that both domestic political and international world orders are experiencing a breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This breakdown is attributed to "unsustainable bad fundamentals that can be easily seen and measured" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Implications of the Shift

The impending [[Global Monetary System Changes | new world order]] is expected to involve a rebalancing of trade imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This includes shifts such as China becoming less dependent on United States debt and the United States becoming less dependent on Chinese manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This transition is anticipated to cause economic pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. To alleviate this pain, there will likely be significant [[effects_of_money_printing_on_economic_markets | money printing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The consequence of such actions is expected to be a decrease in the value of fiat currencies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This aligns with the long-standing thesis of Bitcoin proponents regarding monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

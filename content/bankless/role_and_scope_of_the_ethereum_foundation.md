From: [[bankless]] <br/> 
The [[ethereum_foundations_new_leadership_and_its_goals | Ethereum Foundation (EF)]] serves as a central point and a "compass" for the entire [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>. Its role is that of a steward, stepping up when the ecosystem needs it most and empowering other players to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. The EF operates as a non-profit organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:42">[01:37:42]</a>.

## New Leadership and Strategic Direction

The [[changes_in_the_ethereum_foundation_and_community_dynamics | Ethereum Foundation leadership changes]] to new co-executive directors, Tamas Dajac and Shiae Wong, represents one of many necessary shifts for the future direction of [[ethereums_future_strategic_direction | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. This transition has instilled hope for [[ethereums_future_strategic_direction | Ethereum's progress]], anticipating more operational leadership, accelerated upgrade cadences, and a prioritization of product mindfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

### Co-Executive Directors

*   **Tamas Dajac**
    *   Founder of Nethermind, an [[ethereum_development_priorities | ETH]] client and infrastructure company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
    *   Started building in the [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum ecosystem]] in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

    *   Hopes for [[ethereums_future_strategic_direction | Ethereum]] to be the most decentralized, permissionless, and open blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Key Objectives for the Next 12 Months

The [[ethereum_roadmap | Ethereum Foundation]] has outlined three core objectives for the next 12 months, signaling a shift towards greater operational efficiency and product-centric development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>:

1.  **Scaling [[ethereum_development_priorities | Ethereum]] Layer 1 (L1)**
    *   Aims for a 3x increase in scaling this year, and 10x over four years, reaching 100x scaling over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.
    *   Emphasizes the need for L1 to remain strong and outclass competitors in terms of research quality, protocol strength, decentralization, security, and throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.

2.  **Scaling Blobs for Layer 2s**
    *   Represents general support for the Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem, expressing its connection with L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
    *   L1 provides the anchoring layer from which L2s borrow security and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.

3.  **Improving User Experience (UX)**
    *   Addresses concerns about L2s and L1 not feeling like one cohesive chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
    *   Includes interoperability standards, ease of use, security of asset management, and novelties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>.
    *   Also encompasses Developer Experience (DevX), ensuring builders have a great experience, access to tooling, clarity on roadmaps, and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.

These three objectives are synthesized into a product-centric approach, where [[ethereum_development_priorities | Ethereum]] is viewed as a product to be sold to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>. The focus is on impact, ensuring every action relates to goals that benefit people and involves them in co-designing changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

## Operational Changes and Challenges

The EF is committed to speed of execution, accountability, clear goals, objectives, and metrics to track progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. This means:

*   **Accelerated Hard Forks**: Planning for hard forks every six months, a significant acceleration from the historical 12-18 month cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.
    *   Pectra is the next hard fork focusing on UX improvements via EIPs like EIP-7510 (Mass Max Effective Balance) and EIP-4788 (Beacon Block Root) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.
    *   Fusaka is planned for September-October this year, with immediate devnet spawning after Pectra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.
    *   Glamsterdam is planned for March-June next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>.
*   **Improved Communication**: Actively communicating the [[ethereum_roadmap | roadmap]] and responding to questions, avoiding difficult questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Decision-Making**: Empowering internal team leads and external community members to take decisions and accelerate things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Engagement with Application Builders**: Bringing application developers to early stages of EIP planning and listening to dissenting opinions to build more robust features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

### Perceived Lacks and Expectations

From the community's perspective, while the EF excels in research, values, and fostering a diverse set of stakeholders (like client teams), areas needing improvement include:
*   **Acceleration of Timelines**: Moving faster and committing to deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:28">[03:28:28]</a>.
*   **Communication of the Roadmap**: Simplifying and delivering the roadmap in milestone form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Connecting with Use Cases**: Addressing the perception of being disconnected from day-to-day DeFi use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

### What the EF Does Not Do (Out of Scope)

The EF is not a centralized company like Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. It does not:
*   **Hold ETH as a Treasury**: The community expects the EF to hold [[ethereum_development_priorities | ETH]], but it must sell [[ethereum_development_priorities | ETH]] to fund its operations, internal efforts, and grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.
*   **Directly Develop all Software**: The EF does not build consensus layer clients, which are developed by separate client teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>. While the EF has an execution layer client team (Geth) which provides important input for researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:19">[01:22:19]</a>, it generally avoids building applications or infrastructure directly when the ecosystem is ready to take care of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.
*   **Act as an Owner of [[ethereums_future_strategic_direction | Ethereum]]**: The EF does not coordinate work like talking to Wall Street or governments, although it remains available as a knowledgeable organization to answer questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. It does not act as owners of the [[ethereum_roadmap | Ethereum]] protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:02">[01:42:02]</a>.
*   **Traditional Marketing/Advertising**: The EF avoids branding or advertising, but focuses on communication and clarity as part of its marketing approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:16">[01:25:16]</a>.

The EF strives to be present where there are gaps in the ecosystem, sometimes highlighting problems and helping organizations appear to deal with them, rather than taking on all responsibilities directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. It aims to be more active in business development by helping founders and builders connect with resources, talent, and funding, rather than solely providing grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>. The focus is on creating a network effect within the social layer of [[ethereums_future_strategic_direction | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

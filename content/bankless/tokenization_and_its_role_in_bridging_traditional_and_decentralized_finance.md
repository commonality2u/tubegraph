Decentralized Finance (DeFi) introduces the concept of permissionless, peer-to-peer engagement and networks, a paradigm absent in traditional finance (TradFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While some perceive TradFi's interest as limited to [[tokenization_of_content|tokenization]], it is becoming evident that they are open to the full potential of what DeFi offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Paradigm's "TradFi Tomorrow, DeFi" Report

A survey conducted by the Paradigm policy team, polling 300 TradFi professionals, investigated the engagement level of institutions with crypto and DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The survey explored:
*   Their level of engagement (researching vs. actively involved) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   How they are getting involved (e.g., [[tokenization_of_private_companies|tokenization]], stablecoins, leveraging DeFi infrastructure like DEXes and lending/borrowing applications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Motivations for involvement (e.g., cost reduction, settlement times, transparency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Their overall perspective on DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

A surprising finding was the significant percentage of TradFi companies that view DeFi as critically important to their future business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Scope of the Survey

The 300 TradFi professionals surveyed were global, with significant participation from the US, UK, and Ireland, alongside other markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Participants spanned various roles and institutions, including:
*   Asset managers (e.g., hedge funds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   Retail banks and credit unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>
*   Corporate banks and investment banks (e.g., Goldman Sachs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>
*   Payments companies (e.g., PayPal, Visa, Mastercard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>
*   VCs and private equity firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>
*   Financial market infrastructure providers (e.g., exchanges, DTCC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>

### TradFi Engagement Levels

The survey classified engagement levels into "researching/exploring" (doing analyses, strategic planning) and "active involvement" (building products, pilot programs, investing in crypto firms/DeFi protocols, joining consortiums) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

More than two-thirds (66-67%) of TradFi firms are currently engaged with DeFi in some capacity, either researching it or actively involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This engagement signifies a meaningful interaction beyond mere observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Tokenization: The Primary Bridge

When asked about specific parts of DeFi they were most interested in, TradFi respondents prioritized:
*   [[tokenization_of_content|Tokenization of assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>
*   Stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>
*   Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>
*   Prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>
*   Lending and borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>
*   Interoperability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>

While stablecoins are a significant area of focus, TradFi is even more enthusiastic about [[tokenizing_intellectual_property_on_blockchain|tokenization of other assets]] like stocks, bonds, and derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. The motivation is to bring more traditional financial assets on-chain to achieve benefits similar to stablecoins, such as atomic settlement of multiple assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

### Why Tokenize?
The primary selling point for public blockchains to TradFi institutions is the ability to increase efficiency and reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. Specific benefits include:
*   **Faster settlement times**: Reducing the delays inherent in traditional systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Increased transparency**: Leveraging the immutable and auditable nature of blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Lower transaction costs**: Eliminating intermediaries and reducing manual labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This is particularly appealing given the "insanely inefficient and manual" plumbing of the traditional financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   **Reduced manual labor**: Automating processes that are currently manual and prone to human error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

> "Humans make a bunch more mistakes than smart contracts. So as a result this is just both reducing your compliance increasing your cost and reducing your speed. This is all the witch's brew that makes it appealing to use technology generically and then DeFi and crypto specifically." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>

### The Shifting Narrative: From Meme to Reality
Historically, the "tokenize the world" narrative has been a chant within the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. While stablecoins and tokenized T-bills have gained traction, other assets like equities have been slower to appear on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. However, the current momentum feels different due to:
*   **Maturity of Infrastructure**: Blockchains have scaled to support cheaper transactions, making them more attractive for financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Progress**: Although still a bottleneck, regulatory clarity is emerging, and institutions are positioning themselves for when the regulatory "gate" fully opens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

> "Everyone understands this frontier is about to open up to a lot of existing entities and I think they all want to be well placed to be part of that initial land grab." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>

## Permissionless Finance vs. Private Blockchains

TradFi is increasingly rejecting the notion that private blockchains are as valuable as public, permissionless ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. The limited value of closed-loop consortia of banks is recognized, with a clear need for connectivity to public blockchains for liquidity and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

Layer 2s (L2s) are seen as a key enabler, offering scalability and customization (e.g., privacy features, KYC-only pools) while maintaining connectivity to the robust [[role_of_ethereum_and_other_chains_in_defi_ecosystem|Ethereum ecosystem]] or other Layer 1s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. This suggests a future where centralized L2s may launch on decentralized L1s, offering a hybrid approach that satisfies both institutional needs and the benefits of public infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

> "It's becoming clear that actually connectivity to these public blockchains and to the liquidity and network effects on them is just the killer thing that was actually needed to make these work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>

Institutions are likely to use existing DEXes but with additional logic built into smart contracts for compliance and specific market structures (e.g., verified pools for regulated actors, similar to dark pools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. This hybrid approach will allow liquidity to be traded between different types of pools, benefiting the entire DeFi ecosystem through efficient arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.

## Policy Implications and Future Outlook

Policymakers are urged to adopt policies that allow firms to build on open public infrastructure to reduce inefficiency in the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. While progress is being made in allowing existing TradFi entities to access centralized crypto (CeFi), there's a need to explicitly allow access to DeFi protocols like Aave or Uniswap, and engagement with DAOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.

> "We need to be able to say it's not just the case that you are allowed now to have a Coinbase account... It's also that we need to allow you to access Aave or Uniswap or to be able to access and engage with work on a DAO." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>

The lack of a regulatory model for DeFi (unlike CeFi, which has analogs in developed economies) makes it challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. The guiding principle for policymakers regarding DeFi should be "do no harm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.

For investors and builders, the tremendous demand from TradFi for [[tokenizing_intellectual_property_on_blockchain|tokenization of real-world assets]] (beyond stablecoins) presents a significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. This could massively expand markets for decentralized lending and borrowing, requiring new protocols designed to handle a large and diverse influx of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.

TradFi's interest in public blockchains is driven less by their decentralization or neutrality, and more by their **size** and **economic activity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. The ability to connect to a large, thriving economy (like [[role_of_ethereum_and_other_chains_in_defi_ecosystem|Ethereum]] or [[role_of_ethereum_and_other_chains_in_defi_ecosystem|Solana]]) is the primary draw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. Stability, as opposed to downtime, is also a factor that makes ecosystems like Ethereum attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

The report concludes that DeFi is a "killer app" in demand, with powerful financial firms recognizing its value and preparing for its integration into their core businesses within the next 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.

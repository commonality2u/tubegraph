The [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | Ethereum Layer 2]] ecosystem continues to expand and evolve, with significant developments in platform adoption, data availability solutions, and innovative applications. These advancements highlight the growing maturity and specialization within the [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | Layer 2]] space.

## Sony's Layer 2 Launch and Censorship Controversy
Sony has launched "Sonum," an OP Stack [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | Layer 2]], which is reportedly part of the Superchain initiative. The goal is to maximize creator creativity, benefits, and fan engagement on-chain by protecting content rights and creating fair profit-sharing mechanisms [00:42:21].

The testnet, Sonum Matato, was popular, with 32 projects selected from over 1700 entries for its incubation program [00:43:36]. Sony has partnerships with Sony Pictures, Sony Music, and Sony Music Publishing, with plans to use NFTs for exclusive content access and fan engagement [00:42:50].

However, the launch was met with mixed reactions due to alleged censorship:
*   Sonum reportedly blacklisted meme coins they didn't like [00:44:45].
*   Some deployed contracts were allegedly frozen, rugging users for over $100,000 who purchased meme coins [00:44:58].

Sony's director clarified that restrictions only impacted two specific contracts due to IP violations, and no funds were frozen [00:45:26]. Users and developers can appeal decisions and comply with policies to be removed from the blacklist [00:45:35].

Vitalik Buterin commented on the situation, stating that the Sonum case is a good demonstration of how launching an [[ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum Layer 2]] allows businesses to make fine-grained choices about control [00:48:09]. While Sonum has a centralized sequencer, users retain the ability to withdraw funds to [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Layer 1]] and can force transactions through the [[layer_1_and_layer_2_integration_in_ethereum | Layer 1]] smart contract, albeit with technical skills [00:46:01]. This exemplifies the "pluralism" that is a core value of [[ethereums_challenges_in_the_layer_1_smart_contract_space | Ethereum]], where [[ethereums_rollupcentric_roadmap_and_l2_differentiations | Layer 2s]] can range from centralized to fully open [00:48:48].

## Celo's Transition to an Ethereum Layer 2
Celo is transitioning from a mobile-first EVM-compatible [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Layer 1]] blockchain to a high-performance [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | Ethereum Layer 2]] built on the OP Stack with [[layer_1_and_layer_2_integration_in_ethereum | EigenDA]] and one-block finality [00:50:00]. This transition, termed the "Celo happening," includes cutting its inflation in half [01:03:00].

Celo boasts significant activity, with over 600 million total transactions, 12 million weekly transactions, and 750,000 daily active users [00:15:58]. It hosts 13 native stablecoins across seven different currencies, including USDT on Opera Mini, and facilitates seamless on-chain FX trading. Users can also pay gas fees with ERC20 tokens like USDT and USDC, and send crypto to phone numbers [00:16:10].

This move is significant as [[impact_of_ethereum_scaling_on_layer_2s | Layer 2s]] help unify [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Ethereum Layer 1's]] fragmented landscape, with Celo leading the way for other EVM-compatible [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Layer 1s]] to follow [00:16:33].

## Coinbase Integration with Base and On-Chain Loans
Coinbase has implemented a "defi mullet" strategy, offering Bitcoin-backed on-chain loans to its users [00:51:15]. This service, available to US users (excluding New York), allows customers to get up to $100,000 in USDC [00:53:00].

### How it Works
When a Coinbase customer opts for an on-chain loan:
1.  Their Bitcoin collateral is converted into Coinbase Wrapped BTC (CB BTC) at no cost [00:53:11].
2.  The CB BTC is transferred to Moro on Base, a DeFi protocol [00:53:14].
3.  The Moro protocol disperses USDC to the customer's Coinbase account in under a minute [00:53:38].
This entire process happens on Base, even though users may not be aware of the underlying blockchain mechanics [00:52:40]. Moro is a Coinbase Ventures portfolio company, demonstrating synergies within the Coinbase ecosystem [00:53:20].

## Privacy on Base with Veil and EAS
Veil.xyz, a protocol on Base, now supports Coinbase on-chain verification via [[layer_1_and_layer_2_integration_in_ethereum | Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)]] for verified pool access [00:56:29]. This enables private transactions on Base by functioning as a "permissioned Tornado Cash" [00:57:12].

Users must have an EAS credential from Coinbase, indicating they are a KYC-verified user, to deposit into Veil's privacy pool [00:57:31]. Once deposited, a cryptographic note is generated, which can be transferred to any new wallet (KYC or not) to receive the funds [00:58:09].

This "compromise" offers privacy while maintaining AML/KYC compliance at the deposit point, allowing Coinbase to provide authorities with information about depositors [00:59:04]. It aims to move towards a middle ground for privacy in blockchain transactions [01:00:28]. Over half a million Coinbase-verified accounts are eligible to use this service [01:00:48].

## Aevo's Data Availability Migration
Aevo, an [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | Ethereum Layer 2]] specialized in options and perpetuals (built on the OP Stack and part of the Superchain), is migrating its data availability (DA) solution from Celestia to [[layer_1_and_layer_2_integration_in_ethereum | EigenDA]] [00:54:01].

Aevo noted that while Celestia was an "incredible partner," they require tighter synergy with [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Ethereum]] security, lower costs, and near-instant data throughput [00:54:30]. [[layer_1_and_layer_2_integration_in_ethereum | EigenDA]] is expected to be cheaper and offer higher throughput than Celestia, providing "basically zero cost DA" [00:54:56].

This move is considered a win for [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Ethereum]] as [[layer_1_and_layer_2_integration_in_ethereum | EigenDA]]'s security is based on the economic security and staked value of Ether, unlike Celestia's native token [00:55:10]. The "DA Wars" are expected to continue, with various providers like Celestia, [[layer_1_and_layer_2_integration_in_ethereum | EigenDA]], and [[scaling_ethereum_layer_one | Ethereum's]] own blob space offering competitive solutions [00:55:31].

## Arbitrum's Ecosystem Growth
[[impact_of_ethereum_scaling_on_layer_2s | Arbitrum]] continues to be a prominent [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | Layer 2]], serving as a "One-Stop Hub" for the [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | Ethereum ecosystem]] [00:51:00]. It hosts over 800 applications catering to DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and social platforms [00:16:54]. The platform emphasizes effortless asset movement between chains and easy ecosystem access via its network of bridges and on-ramps [00:17:14].# Developments in the Ethereum Layer 2 Ecosystem

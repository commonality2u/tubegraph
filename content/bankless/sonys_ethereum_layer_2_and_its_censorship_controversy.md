Sony has launched Sonum L2, an [[layer_1_and_layer_2_integration_in_ethereum | Ethereum Layer 2]] built on the OP Stack, which may also be part of the Superchain initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>. The launch, however, was met with mixed reactions due to early censorship attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>.

## Sonum L2 Overview

Sony states that in this early phase, their aim is to maximize creators' creativity, benefits, and fan engagement on-chain by protecting content rights and creating fair profit-sharing mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. This approach empowers creators to thrive across both digital and real worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>.

The testnet for Sonum, named Sonum Matato, was reportedly very popular, with 32 projects selected from over 1,700 entries for the Spark incubation program, covering entertainment, gaming, social platforms, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Sony has partnerships with Sony Pictures, Sony Music, and Sony Music Publishing, which might utilize NFTs to grant fans access to exclusive content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>.

Two projects are currently active on Sonum:
*   A fan marketing platform simplifying NFT issuance and data analysis for brands, creators, and enterprises to use NFTs for fan engagement and marketing, expected to launch in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>.
*   S-Blocks Exchange, a DEX with its own mobile app, offering Bitcoin rewards for new accounts and trades, alongside an NFT distribution campaign in 2025, available only in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>.

## Censorship Controversy

The launch faced criticism from crypto Twitter, with some users stating that Sonum L2 was actively blacklisting meme coins it "doesn't like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Concerns were raised about the implications for other [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | Layer 2s]] if such censorship becomes a precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. One user claimed that Sonum had frozen some deployed contracts and "rugged" users who purchased meme coins for over $100,000 in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

Sony responded by clarifying that the restrictions only impacted two specific contracts due to IP violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. They stated that no funds were frozen and that users and developers could appeal decisions, with dialogue already underway with one restricted project to update materials to comply with policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Technical Bypass

Despite the censorship, a user named Donnath from Layer2BE demonstrated how to bypass Sonum's centralized sequencer to buy a banned token through a "forced transaction" via the [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | Layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This involves crafting specific call data to directly interact with the [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | Layer 1]] smart contract, a technical process not for the average end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This capability means that while transactions can be censored in real-time by the sequencer, users retain the ability to withdraw funds to the [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | Layer 1]], ensuring they cannot be directly stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. However, property rights are "nerfed" as transactions become difficult without direct [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | Layer 1]] interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Vitalik Buterin's Perspective

Vitalik Buterin commented on the Sonum situation, calling it a "good live demonstration of how launching an [[impact_of_ethereum_scaling_on_layer_2s | Ethereum Layer 2]] is great for businesses and users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. He emphasized that businesses can make "very fine-grain choices" about the level of control they retain versus what they give to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Buterin noted that even with chosen rules, everything on-chain is transparent and auditable by third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. He further explained that while a very close system with no escape hatch and operator control over state roots is possible, users would be aware of what they are "getting into," and independent internet communities would help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This aligns with the "pluralism" Vitalik has consistently preached for Ethereum, where [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] can range from super centralized to fully open, offering flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Implications for [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | Ethereum Layer 2s]]

The Sonum case highlights the trade-offs inherent in [[ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Layer 2s]] with centralized sequencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. While such [[impact_of_ethereum_scaling_on_layer_2s | Layer 2s]] can accommodate corporate needs like IP enforcement, the underlying [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | Layer 1]] provides a "trap door" or escape hatch, limiting the extent of censorship or fund freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. This allows for a "rainbow" or "kaleidoscope" of flavors, where different [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] can cater to various use cases, from "corpo" applications with content moderation to more "Cipher Punk" environments offering complete censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 
The [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum ecosystem]] is currently undergoing significant changes in both its internal dynamics and leadership, leading to a notable shift in sentiment and strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>. These [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | developments]] are seen as repositioning [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum]] for future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

## [[Evolution of Ethereum Foundation and Leadership | Ethereum Foundation Leadership Changes]]

A key aspect of this shift is the new leadership at the [[Ethereum Foundation leadership changes | Ethereum Foundation]] (EF).
*   **New Co-Executive Directors** Tomas and Hao are the incoming co-executive directors, expected to bring a "refreshing energy" to the [[ethereum_foundations_new_leadership_and_its_goals | Ethereum Foundation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>. Tomas, for example, has publicly shared his calendar and engaged directly with critics on Twitter, indicating a more open approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This contrasts with past perceptions of the EF leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.
    *   Tomas directly responded to Kyle Samani's criticism:
        > "Hi Kyle, appreciate you bringing this up. We're opening to hearing different perspectives, critical or otherwise. Here's some additional availability for the critical ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>
*   **Cultural Shift** This new leadership is seen as initiating a "culture set from the top," permeating outwards across the [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum]] community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.

## Etherealize and Danny Ryan

Another significant development is the growth of Etherealize.
*   **Danny Ryan's Role** Etherealize has made a "huge name for themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a> and brought on Danny Ryan as a co-founder, alongside three others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Duo with EF** Danny Ryan's close relationship with the EF suggests that Etherealize and the EF will function as a "dynamic duo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. Etherealize will target areas the EF is not equipped for, while the EF handles what Etherealize cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

## Strategic Reprioritization

The [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum acceleration effort]] includes a renewed focus on core development and scaling:
*   **Scaling as Priority** There's a push to accelerate critical scaling initiatives like blob scaling and increasing the L1 gas limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>. The community largely agrees on prioritizing scaling to capture market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.
*   **Future Roadmap** This reprioritization represents the next five-year roadmap for [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.

## [[Ethereum community culture | Community and "ETH is Money"]]

The sentiment within the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] has improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>, partly due to these public [[changes_in_the_ethereum_foundation_and_community_dynamics | changes]] in leadership and increased public engagement from EF members and core developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
*   **Ether Guild** The Ether Guild (Ethoney HQ on Twitter) has launched as a community-driven effort to support [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ether]] as a monetary asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. This initiative, which evolved from the "ETH is money" effort, aims to unite different facets of [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum]] â€“ [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ether]] as money, [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum]] as the world computer, and public goods funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on ETH as an Asset** There's a strong community demand for greater focus on [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | ETH]] the asset, beyond just [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum]] the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. It's argued that a valuable [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ether]] directly supports the mission of [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum]] as a world computer, leading to increased network security, better coordination, more economic bandwidth, and greater attention and building interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>. This is seen as a win-win, as a higher [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | ETH]] price also benefits the [[Ethereum Foundation leadership changes | Ethereum Foundation]] financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.

## Application Layer Developments

On the application layer, new projects continue to emerge, leveraging the [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum]] ecosystem:
*   **Megapot** An example is Megapot, a "global internet lottery" where users can buy tickets or act as LPs (the "house"). This contrasts with traditional lotteries by allowing users to be the house, an option not available in traditional systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>. This type of project, simple yet impactful, has been ideated since [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum]]'s early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.

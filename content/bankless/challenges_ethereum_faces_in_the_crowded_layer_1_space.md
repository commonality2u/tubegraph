Ethereum faces significantly greater challenges today than in 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The network currently finds itself in a competitive environment where it is not ideally suited to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Loss of "Moneyiness"

Ether, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, has reportedly "lost its moneyiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This has resulted in it falling into an "inferior valuation bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, specifically as a [[smart_contract_layer_1|smart contract layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Increased Competition

The [[smart_contract_layer_1|smart contract layer 1]] marketplace is described as "very crowded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. There is doubt about Ethereum's ability to effectively compete in this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Competitors in this space are characterized as being:
*   Much more centralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Faster moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Willing to "cut corners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

Ethereum needs to exit this competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

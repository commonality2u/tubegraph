The intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence represents a significant frontier in technology, with advancements happening at an unprecedented pace. The podcast "Bankless" explores these [[Emerging trends in AI and crypto | emerging trends]], noting that the world is now delving into "internet intelligence" in addition to internet money and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Rapid Acceleration of AI

Artificial intelligence is experiencing an exponential curve of acceleration, surpassing even the rapid growth seen in cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This acceleration is significantly faster than Moore's Law, with AI training models doubling in speed approximately every 18 weeks, compared to the 18 months for processor transistor density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Quantum Computing Breakthroughs

Recent developments highlight this rapid progress. Just recently, Microsoft announced a new [[quantum_computing_and_cryptography | quantum computer]] named Groq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This new "Frontier Model" was developed in only 12 months, signaling a new era of computational improvements downstream of new forms of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Beyond quantum computing, other related "Frontier breakthroughs" are happening concurrently, including advances in genetic mutations, chromosomes, and protein folding, all within a single week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>. These simultaneous breakthroughs suggest that AI's "takeoff" — the point where AI can self-improve and generate new knowledge independently of humans — might be in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>.

## Implications for the Future

[[Quantum computing and cryptography | Quantum computing]] is seeing monthly breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>. While the full implications are not yet known, it is understood that quantum computers can solve complex problems and potentially break encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. This rapidly evolving landscape underscores the importance of staying informed about these [[Emerging trends in AI and crypto | frontier technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.

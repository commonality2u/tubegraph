The Ethereum community has been grappling with defining its core problems, moving past the notion of price decline to address underlying issues in its growth and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:02">[08:00:02]</a>. The shift in market dynamics and the rise of other ecosystems have highlighted areas where Ethereum needs to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

## Defining the Problem in Ethereum
A significant problem is the decline in activity on Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1), leading to less app building and fewer new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This has meant that Ethereum is no longer the "obvious default platform for building everything in crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. While the ETH price lagging the market for almost three years signals this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, directly chasing the price is not the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. Instead, the lack of growth on the Ethereum L1 is seen as a primary cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

Some proposed problems include:
*   **Marketing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>
*   **Lack of a clear "northstar" or product problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>
*   **A [[ethereums_leadership_and_community_dynamics | leadership problem]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>

The **rollup-centric roadmap** has been a point of debate, with some questioning its effectiveness, though many maintain it's the correct long-term strategy for scaling a blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. The issue is that the L1 was "neglected" during its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and the Ethereum Foundation's Role
Historically, the [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_and_community_dynamics | Ethereum Foundation leadership and community dynamics]] (EF) operated as an "ivory tower," focusing on high-brow research without sufficient active listening to app builders and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:22]</a>. It didn't treat Ethereum as a product to serve its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This long-standing issue stemmed from the EF seeing its role primarily as a public goods funder rather than a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. This approach was intentional to avoid appearing centralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>, as it was considered the "only option available at the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>.

At its inception, the EF's research-focused approach made sense, as there was a significant need to solve fundamental blockchain scaling challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. This disproportionately benefited Ethereum, which held a large share of developer mindshare and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>. However, the meta has shifted; core scaling directions are largely understood, and other challengers like Solana have emerged, making a research-only focus less impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.

This decentralized structure, while a core benefit, also presented unique challenges:
*   No one was explicitly in charge of the entire ecosystem's coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:14]</a>.
*   Decision-making often happened in very small, insular groups, sometimes even just a few individuals in a chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>.
*   Considerations like product experience and market relevance were often secondary to long-term technical perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
*   Ethereum "rejected the growth" by not prioritizing L1 expansion, anticipating L2s would handle it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.

## Shift in the Ethereum Foundation's Role and Culture
There is a significant [[challenges_and_changes_within_the_ethereum_foundation | change underway within the Ethereum Foundation]], driven by a realization that things "have to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:00">[31:27:00]</a>. The EF is moving from solely a public goods funder to an organization that feels a responsibility to guide Ethereum holistically, encompassing product experience, strategy, and overall vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>.

Key aspects of this shift include:
*   **New Leadership**: The EF has transitioned leadership, with Aya Yamaguchi moving to president and Tomas and Shiao stepping in as co-CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>. Tomas, in particular, is noted for bringing a lot of energy and focusing on action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>.
*   **Open Communication**: A significant cultural change is the opening of internal communication channels, making discussions about strategy accessible to more EF members, contrasting with past small, closed-group decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>.
*   **Product Mindset**: There's a clear shift towards prioritizing the "product mindset" for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This means acknowledging that Ethereum needs to deliver what users and institutions need *today*, not just in several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:23:00">[32:23:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling the L1**: There's a consensus to scale the L1, with a goal of reaching around 100 million gas per year by the end of the current year, and a 10x increase in capacity within two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54:00">[36:54:00]</a>. This involves:
    *   Leveraging existing headroom without technological changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
    *   Implementing new features like delayed execution and access list parallelization in upcoming hard forks (e.g., Glamsterdam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>.
    *   Utilizing ZK-based scaling solutions in the longer term (2-3 years out), which can make the L1 technically function like a rollup for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.
*   **L2 Integration**: The roadmap remains rollup-centric, but with a focus on making L2s feel more like a cohesive part of Ethereum, through seamless interoperability and standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The L1 aims to provide services that make L2s "sticky" and valuable, such as data availability (DA) and potentially sequencer services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.
*   **Addressing Block Times**: While scaling block size is a priority, reducing block times is also on the agenda to improve DeFi UX and reduce MEV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This includes exploring optimistic pre-confirmations and potentially reducing slot times to 6 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

## Challenges and Optimism
The process of reorienting such a large and [[decentralization_progress_in_blockchain_projects | decentralized ecosystem]] is slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. The challenge lies in changing the roadmap when needed, which requires a new "meta adaptability" muscle to flex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>. Despite the work ahead, there is strong consensus on the urgency and short-to-medium term actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

The **Ethereum Foundation Leadership Changes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a> and the broader shift in the EF's attitude are seen as highly positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>. The EF is extending its responsibilities to include product and strategy, not just public goods funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. While the mindset has shifted significantly, the actual implementation and execution are still ongoing and need to be proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>.

Ethereum is believed to have a clear path to success, but it requires execution and a focus on overcoming its weaknesses rather than just relying on its inherent strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>.

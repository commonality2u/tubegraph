Traditional banks have historically struggled with innovation; for example, Visa, a significant development from the banking sector, emerged during an era when technological advancements were much slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While domestic banking systems are improving, with real-time payment networks emerging that can be faster and cheaper than blockchain rails for many domestic use cases, their limitations become more apparent in international contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Limitations of Traditional Cross-Border Banking

The global landscape is shifting towards increased protectionism, with the United States reducing ties with some allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. In many countries, local currencies are experiencing inflation, leading to a diminished demand for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. People in these regions often desire access to US dollars and US dollar-denominated goods and services, such as Netflix or OpenAI's ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Paying for such goods through the traditional banking system can incur a "tax" of approximately 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Role of Stablecoins

[[stablecoins_advantages_over_traditional_banking_systems | Stablecoins]] offer a solution to these challenges, enabling payments without the high fees associated with traditional banking, presenting a form of regulatory arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Younger populations, in particular, are seeking easier access to US dollars and US dollar goods through these alternative payment rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Macroeconomic Implications

From a broader macroeconomic perspective, there is a possibility that the number of global currencies may decrease significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This could lead to a "currency war" primarily between the US Dollar, the Euro, and the Renminbi, with many other national currencies potentially struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The question of whether [[the cultural and economic implications of meme coins | meme coins]] fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a recurring topic in crypto regulation discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce emphasizes that "facts and circumstances matter" when determining jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## SEC's Stance on Meme Coin Jurisdiction

Commissioner Peirce suggests that the public should not assume an SEC regulatory presence for [[the cultural and economic implications of meme coins | meme coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While people can enjoy and spend money on [[the cultural and economic implications of meme coins | meme coins]] and other things, this freedom comes with the understanding that the SEC may not be providing a regulatory backstop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. The popularity or size of a [[the cultural and economic implications of meme coins | meme coin]] project does not automatically mean it falls under the SEC's purview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>.

> "Just because something is out there and people are... it's popular does not mean that it will fit within the SEC's jurisdiction. So I just caution people not to assume that there's going to be an SEC regulatory backstop to everything..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>

## Investor Responsibility

A key message from Commissioner Peirce is that investors should not expect a government agency to set rules for every investment or to make them whole if the price of an asset, like a [[the cultural and economic implications of meme coins | meme coin]], goes down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. If society desires choices, it must accept the responsibility that comes with those choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. This includes being a "discriminating" buyer who thinks about the consequences of their investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.

## Fraud Laws and Inter-Agency Referrals

Even if the SEC does not have specific jurisdiction over certain [[the cultural and economic implications of meme coins | meme coins]], general anti-fraud laws in the United States still apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. If the SEC identifies potential fraud in an area where it lacks direct jurisdiction, it will refer the matter to the appropriate regulatory body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. The goal is to shut down "bad actors" rather than "good actors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

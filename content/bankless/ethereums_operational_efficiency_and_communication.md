The [[Ethereums strategic pivot and leadership changes|Ethereum Foundation (EF)]]'s shift to new co-executive directors, Tamas Stanjac and Shiae Wang, marks a significant change in the network's direction. This transition has instilled hope for [[Ethereums future strategic direction|Ethereum]]'s future progress, emphasizing more operational leadership, accelerated upgrade cadences, and prioritized product mindfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The EF acts as a central coordinator, a "compass" for the entire operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Core Objectives for the Next Chapter

The EF has outlined three clear objectives for [[Ethereums strategic pivot and ongoing developments|Ethereum]]'s next chapter, which they view as turning [[Ethereums future strategic direction|Ethereum]] into a product to "sell to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>:

1.  **[[Ethereums strategic pivot and scaling layer 1 efforts|Scaling Ethereum Layer 1]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>: Acknowledging community desire for a stronger mainnet that outclasses competitors in research, protocol strength, decentralization, and security, while also improving speed and throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>. The goal is a 3x increase in throughput this year, and 10x next year, with an overall target of 100x scaling over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.
2.  **[[Ethereums Scaling and Bandwidth Optimization|Scaling Blobs]] for Layer 2s** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>: This signifies general support for the L2 ecosystem, binding it to the L1 by delivering anchoring and security values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
3.  **Improving User Experience (UX)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>: This includes addressing issues of L1-L2 fragmentation to make them feel like "one chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>, improving interoperability standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, enhancing security, reducing latency, and improving DevX (developer experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.

## Community Perception and EF's Role

The [[Ethereum community culture|Ethereum community]] generally gives the EF high marks for its research, embodiment of values, diverse stakeholders, and vibrant open-source nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>. However, areas where the EF has been perceived as lacking include:
*   **Speed and Acceleration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:28:00">[32:28:00]</a>: A desire for faster progress and commitment to timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>.
*   **Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:49:00">[32:49:00]</a>: A need for clearer roadmap communication, simplified milestones, and more frequent updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>.
*   **"Ivory Tower" Perception** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>: Feeling disconnected from the practical use cases and daily DeFi users.

Tamas believes these problems are "very much fixable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:11:00">[38:11:00]</a>. This includes addressing communication, overcoming past regulatory burdens, and leveraging the strong desire within the community to help [[Ethereums strategic pivot and community reactions|Ethereum]] succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>.

### Operational Changes and Mindset
The new leadership aims to bring an "energy of experience of building organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> to the EF. Key operational changes and a shift in mindset include:

*   **Accelerating Processes**: Tamas intends to address internal communication problems and inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, empowering team leads to act as real leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a> and accelerate decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Proactive Communication**: Moving the EF from a less frequent communicator of roadmaps to one that communicates a lot and doesn't avoid difficult questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   **Product-Centric Approach**: The EF seeks to shift to a product-centric ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, ensuring that all changes and new features relate to making an impact on users, involving them in co-design, and maintaining quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.
*   **Faster Cadence**: The goal is to move from a historical hard fork cadence of 12-18 months to every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>. This means immediate devnet spawning after a fork (e.g., Fusaka after Pectra) and active efforts to prevent delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.
*   **Empowering the Ecosystem**: While the EF doesn't directly build all engineering components (like consensus clients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a> or engage in direct business development like Wall Street outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>, it aims to be a helper and coordinator. This includes being available to answer questions for governments and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>, helping organizations appear where there are gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>, and connecting founders with resources, talent, and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>. The EF's role is to amplify the efforts of participants by creating a robust social network within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>.
*   **Metrics for Success**: The EF will focus on speed of execution, accountability, clear goals, objectives, and metrics to track progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. The 100x scaling over four years serves as a significant north star metric for the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>.

The new leadership aims for [[Ethereums role in modernizing financial infrastructure|Ethereum]] to be seen as a global, neutral layer for all economy and transactions, winning by impact and upholding values like privacy, security, open-source access, and censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

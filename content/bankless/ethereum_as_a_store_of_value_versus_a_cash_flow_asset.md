From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The core discussion around Ether (ETH) as an asset centers on its fundamental valuation framework: whether it should be primarily understood as a [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]] commodity or a discounted cash flow (DCF) asset [00:00:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Sam Kasmanian, CEO and co-founder of Frax, argues that the Ethereum community's focus on valuing ETH via a DCF model has been detrimental to its price performance relative to Bitcoin (BTC) [00:01:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Valuation Frameworks

There are two primary ways to value an asset from a first-principles perspective, often with mixtures [00:06:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>:

### 1. Fundamentals (Discounted Cash Flow - DCF)
This view treats an asset as equity-like, representing a claim on future cash flows produced by something, whether smart contracts, a group of people, or a product [00:06:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This is analogous to valuing a tech stock based on its revenues [00:05:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### 2. Commodity
In this view, an asset does not represent any claim on cash flows [00:07:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Its value is driven by demand, industrial use cases, or its role as a [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]] [00:07:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Gold, for example, is valued for its industrial uses and its function as a [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]], without representing a claim on anyone's work [00:07:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Bitcoin primarily falls into this category, with its value stemming from its scarcity and [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]] properties [00:07:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## The Case for Ethereum as a Commodity

Sam Kasmanian contends that the Ethereum community's shift towards a DCF valuation model for [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | ETH the asset]] is a "mistake" [00:21:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

### Impact of EIP-1559 and Proof of Stake
The transition to Proof of Stake and the implementation of [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | EIP-1559]] fundamentally changed how [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | ETH the asset]] is predominantly defined [00:19:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | EIP-1559]], which burns a portion of transaction fees, led to discussions about ETH's "cash flows" or "revenues" [00:19:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

This focus on DCF-like metrics (price-to-earnings, burned ETH as dividends) anchors the asset's value to its "floor" price, which is determined by its industrial use case (block space demand) [00:29:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. If the community exclusively focuses on this floor, the asset's value is limited, potentially leading to a much lower valuation (e.g., $500-$600 ETH if valued solely on current DCF) [00:29:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

### Bitcoin's Valuation Advantage
Bitcoin's success in maintaining its [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]] narrative is attributed to its inability to be coherently valued by discounted cash flows [00:36:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. Its fixed supply (21 million hard cap) creates a simple, understandable narrative that forces the community to discuss it solely as a digital commodity [00:36:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. Sam argues that even if Bitcoin implemented a fee-burning mechanism similar to [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | EIP-1559]], its community wouldn't redefine it as a cash flow asset [00:25:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

## The Social Construction of Asset Identity

The identity of a digital asset like Ether is not merely about marketing but about a "socially constructed definition" that causally changes what it *actually is* [00:13:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. If everyone collectively believes ETH is a [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]], it becomes one [00:15:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. A fragmented or "schizophrenic" definition, where some see it as a tech stock and others as a commodity, leads to chaos and prevents a unified, stronger valuation [00:14:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

### Separating ETH the Technology from ETH the Asset
It is crucial to separate "ETH the technology" from "[[Ethereums identity as a store of value | ETH the asset]]" [00:09:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Ethereum's underlying technology, its roadmap, and its ethos of decentralized computation are "brilliant" and make the world a better place [00:11:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. However, the success of the technology does not automatically translate to a higher price for [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | ETH the asset]] if its fundamental definition is flawed [00:11:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Addressing the ETH/BTC Ratio Decline
The significant decline in the [[bitcoin_vs_ethereum_vs_other_layer_1_tokens | ETH/BTC ratio]] since late 2021 (from 0.08 to 0.018, an 80% loss) is linked to this social definition problem [00:17:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. While the move to Proof of Stake is not inherently bearish [00:31:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>, it coincided with the shift in narrative focus towards revenues and DCF, which allowed for a "lower anchor" for its valuation [00:32:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.

## Charting a Path Forward

To achieve a higher valuation for [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | ETH the asset]], the community needs to:

*   **Unify the Narrative:** Agree on a predominant social definition for ETH. Sam aligns with Ryan Sean Adams' "Blue Money Religion" concept, advocating for a "maximalist," fervent, and unforgiving stance on [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | ETH as a store of value]] [00:45:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. This means emphasizing [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | ETH's identity as a store of value]] and its role as the "fundamental ledger" [00:48:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.
*   **Reframe [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | EIP-1559]]:** View the burn mechanism as an "industrial use case" for ETH, similar to gold's use in electronics, which establishes a demand floor but isn't the primary driver for its higher valuation as a commodity [01:03:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.
*   **Commit to Emission Stability:** While not advocating for a fixed total supply like Bitcoin, there needs to be a social commitment that the emission algorithm will *never* change [01:11:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>. This predictability aids its classification as a [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]] [01:12:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>.
*   **Balance Pragmatism and Maximalism:** The Ethereum technology and product development should remain open, adaptable, and pluralistic ("big tent mentality") [00:58:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. However, when discussing [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | ETH the asset]], the approach must be "maximalist" and "unforgiving" [00:58:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>. This allows for innovation at the technology layer while maintaining a strong, unified narrative for the asset.

Sam Kasmanian remains bullish on [[Ethereums identity as a store of value | ETH the asset]]'s potential to reach much higher valuations (e.g., $80,000 ETH compared to $800,000 BTC), provided these fundamental identity issues are addressed through coordinated social consensus [01:20:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>.

The potential rebalancing of the [[global_macroeconomic_factors_affecting_us_markets_and_economy | global economy]] is anticipated due to concerns over future US policies, including capital controls or taxes on foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This potential shift has led some non-Americans to question the safety of keeping their property domiciled in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Concerns Regarding US Capital Controls

There are concerns that imposing capital controls or taxes on foreigners could lead to capital exiting US shores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Such an exit would likely result in the S&P going down and other effects similar to those seen post-liberation day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Mathematically, reducing the capital account surplus necessitates foreigners selling their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Impact on US Markets

Foreigners parking trillions of dollars of export earnings into American markets has historically been the basis for the outperformance of American property, stock, and bond markets over the last 30 years compared to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. If foreigners begin to leave, these markets are mathematically expected to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Even a marginal number of people leaving can trigger market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Policy Responses to Capital Outflows

Historically, whenever markets decline, especially the bond market, and volatility increases, money is printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The consequence of implementing capital controls is that the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and politicians would all be compelled to create policies to provide dollars to replace the capital that foreigners are withdrawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This replacement would involve printing new money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Implications for Alternative Assets

A market downturn resulting from capital exodus is considered beneficial for [[crypto_markets_response_to_federal_economic_policies | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The expected consequence of widespread money printing in response to capital outflows is that assets like gold and Bitcoin would "go through the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This scenario represents the primary trade associated with this rebalancing of the [[global_macroeconomic_factors_affecting_us_markets_and_economy | global economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

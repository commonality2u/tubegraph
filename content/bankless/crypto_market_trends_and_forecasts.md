The crypto market experienced a rebound this week after an earlier period of decline, largely driven by positive U.S. economy data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This data has implications for the market's trajectory into 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Market Performance Overview

### Bitcoin and Ethereum Trends
Bitcoin (BTC) saw a significant increase, rising 7.5% on the week to nearly $100,000, briefly surpassing this mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The overall sentiment suggests the bull market remains in flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) has been lagging, only rising 2.5% on the week to $3,325 from $3,250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The ETH/BTC ratio has fallen to 0.0334 and appears to be in a two-year downtrend, despite earlier signs of bottoming and optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Analyst Ben Cowan had previously predicted ETH would "go home" to lower ranges, which has occurred, though he also forecast a reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

The total [[market_trends_and_performance_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum | crypto market cap]] stands at $3.66 trillion, not far from its all-time high of $3.87 trillion set in December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Altcoin Surges
Several "down market coins" or "retail coins" have seen significant gains, impacting Bitcoin dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. These include XRP, Iota, Stellar, Cardano, and Litecoin, echoing market movements seen in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

XRP's fully diluted valuation (FDV) is notably close to Ethereum's, being only 16% away from flipping ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This is despite Ripple's FDV being almost double its circulating supply due to its treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. XRP gained 45-46% over the last seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

This surge is partly attributed to retail investors re-entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Additionally, recent statements from former President Donald Trump regarding promoting U.S.-domiciled crypto companies may have boosted confidence in centralized organizations like Ripple, which could "cozy up" to the new administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Hedera Hashgraph, based in Dallas, Texas, also saw significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### [[trends_and_highlights_in_the_ai_crypto_investment_market | AI Crypto Sector Trends]]
The AI agent market cap experienced a nearly 50% drawdown, dropping from $20 billion on January 6th to $11.5 billion by January 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. However, it has since recovered to $17.5 billion, up 30% from its recent bottom, indicating high volatility typical of "frothy Frontier Tech bubbles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Macroeconomic Factors and Their Impact

Last week, U.S. stock markets tumbled despite positive labor department reports showing an addition of 56,000 jobs in December, exceeding expectations of 155,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This counterintuitive reaction occurred because strong job market data and contained inflation led investors to believe the Federal Reserve would not implement further rate cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Bank of America is now even projecting no Fed rate cuts this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

This scenario, while potentially positive for national debt repayment (due to higher interest rates), is not necessarily bullish for asset holders who prefer easy monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. It could be seen as downside protection but trading off upside risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. The incoming Trump administration is anticipated to unleash "fiscal cannon" spending, potentially leading to a "risk on, high inflation era," a concept discussed by macroeconomist Lyn Alden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Political Landscape and Future Forecasts for Crypto

The incoming Trump administration is expected to be significantly more pro-crypto.

### SEC and Regulatory Changes
Gary Gensler, the outgoing SEC Chair, pursued legal actions against Elon Musk and attempted to appeal the Ripple vs. SEC ruling that largely favored Ripple's classification as a non-security for secondary market sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

With Trump entering office, it's anticipated that:
*   Frivolous cases against U.S.-based crypto companies (e.g., Uniswap, Kraken, Coinbase, Robinhood) will likely "evaporate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.
*   Trump is receptive to the idea of a "strategic reserve" including "coins founded in the US" like Solana, USD Coin, and XRP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
*   He is expected to repeal SAB 121 on day one, which currently prevents U.S. banks from custodying crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. This policy was previously vetoed by the Biden administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.

### Cabinet Appointments and Legislative Outlook
The projected cabinet members are largely considered pro-crypto:
*   **Treasury Secretary**: Scott Bessent, a major donor and economic advisor for Trump, is recognized for his progressive stance on crypto, viewing it as integral to economic freedom and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. He is almost assured confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **SEC Chair**: Paul Atkins is the likely pick, with widespread Republican support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. Hester Peirce or Mark Uyeda are expected to serve as acting chairs in the interim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.
*   **CFTC Chair**: Options include former commissioners Brian Quintenz and Summer Mersinger, both considered favorable to crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
*   **Secretary of Commerce**: Howard Lutnick, Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald (which acquired a 5% stake in Tether), is the nominee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

On the legislative side, Representative Tom Emmer has been appointed as the vice chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. He aims to ensure the future of digital assets is guided by American values and to foster an environment where innovation can thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. Priorities include market structure frameworks like FIT21, restrictions on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and promoting global dollar-backed stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

This shift represents a "complete 180" from the policies of 2022 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. The crypto community appears to have dodged a potential continuation of unfavorable policies, such as the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau's (CFPB) proposed rule to hold non-custodial wallet providers liable for asset losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. This rule would have made it impossible to run non-custodial wallets in the U.S. due to impossible liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

## Industry Developments

### Sony's Layer 2
Sony has launched its OP Stack Layer 2, aiming to maximize creator creativity and fan engagement on-chain through content rights protection and fair profit sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. However, it has faced controversy due to centralized control:
*   The Layer 2 has been blacklisting meme coins infringing on IP rights and has frozen some deployed contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   Sony stated these restrictions only impacted two contracts due to IP violations, and users can appeal decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.
*   Despite censorship by the centralized sequencer, a user demonstrated that it's still possible to bypass it and transact through the Layer 1 smart contract, allowing users to withdraw funds to mainnet even if frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
*   Vitalik Buterin views this as a "good live demonstration" of how Layer 2s allow businesses to make "fine-grain choices" on control, with all actions remaining transparent and auditable on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.

### Coinbase and Base Integration
Coinbase is now offering Bitcoin-backed on-chain loans of up to $100,000 in USDC to its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. This is executed using the DeFi protocol Moro on Coinbase's Layer 2, Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>. Users' Bitcoin collateral is converted to Coinbase-wrapped BTC and transferred to Moro, with USDC disbursed to their Coinbase account, all happening on-chain without the user necessarily knowing the underlying DeFi mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. This represents a "DeFi mullet" â€” traditional finance (TradFi) in the front, DeFi in the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>.

### Data Availability Wars
Aevo, an options and derivatives Layer 2 built on the OP Stack, is migrating from Celestia DA (Data Availability) to EigenDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. This move is driven by the need for tighter synergy with Ethereum security, lower costs, and near-instant data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. EigenDA is currently cheaper and offers higher throughput than Celestia, and its security is based on staked ETH, which is seen as a win for Ethereum's economic security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

### Privacy on Base
Veil, a protocol on Base, now supports Coinbase on-chain verification via Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for verified pool access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>. This effectively enables private transactions on Base. It functions like a permissioned Tornado Cash:
*   Users need a wallet with an EAS credential from Coinbase, attesting they are a KYC'd user, to deposit ETH into Veil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>.
*   Once deposited, a cryptographic note is generated, allowing users to withdraw the ETH to a new, un-KYC'd wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.
*   This "privacy with AML/KYC" allows Coinbase to identify depositors, while allowing withdrawals to any address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. Over half a million Coinbase-verified accounts are now eligible to use this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

### Berachain's Upcoming Launch
Berachain, a separate EVM-equivalent Layer 1 with a "proof of liquidity" consensus mechanism, has accumulated $1.6 billion in pre-launch deposits on Ethereum, indicating its anticipated mainnet launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Tether Relocating to El Salvador
Tether has acquired a license to operate as a digital asset service provider and stablecoin issuer in El Salvador, planning to relocate its headquarters there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This move is attributed to El Salvador's "forward-thinking policies," favorable regulatory environment, and growing Bitcoin-savvy community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>. This aligns with the "sovereign individual" thesis, where nations compete to attract internet-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

## Banking Innovation and Real-time Payments
Historically, banks have not been strong innovators, with Visa being a notable exception from a time when technological advancements were slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Domestically, banks are expected to continue performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The emergence of real-time payment networks in various jurisdictions will enable payments that are as fast as, and cheaper than, blockchain rails for many domestic applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Global Economic Shifts and Protectionism
The United States is currently disengaging from some allies, leading to an increasingly protectionist stance both domestically and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This represents a [[rebalancing_of_the_global_economy_due_to_us_policies | rebalancing of the global economy due to US policies]] and has [[implications_of_changing_global_trade_relationships | changing global trade relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Many countries are experiencing local currency inflation, leading to a lack of demand for their own currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Demand for US Dollars and Stablecoins
In these countries, there is a strong desire for US dollars, as well as for US dollar-denominated goods and services like Netflix or OpenAI's ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Using the traditional banking system to pay for these goods often incurs a 10% tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, stablecoins offer a regulatory arbitrage, allowing payments without this tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Younger populations, utilizing these payment rails, show increased access to US dollars and US dollar-denominated products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Emergence of Currency Wars
A broader [[global_macroeconomic_factors_affecting_us_markets_and_economy | macroeconomic trend]] suggests a future with fewer global currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This could lead to a "currency war" primarily between the US dollar, the Euro, and the Renminbi, potentially devaluing many other national currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This scenario indicates a significant shift in the [[global_monetary_system_changes | global monetary system changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

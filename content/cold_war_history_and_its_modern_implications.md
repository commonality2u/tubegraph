This article summarizes insights from a podcast episode discussing the complex geopolitical interactions between Russia, the United States, and China, particularly concerning India and Pakistan during the Cold War, and the lasting implications of these dynamics.

**Disclaimer:** The speaker in the podcast episode works for the US Government. The ideas presented are their own and do not necessarily represent those of the US Government, the US Navy Department, the US Department of Defense, or the Naval War College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Introduction: A Game of Nations

The episode frames the Cold War interactions in South Asia as a story of three main protagonists—Russia, the United States, and China—attempting to influence India and Pakistan, often with unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Two major themes emerge: the complexities of intervening in other nations' problems and the critical importance of understanding geopolitical alignments before taking action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The period was also marked by a series of "limited wars," conflicts fought for objectives less than regime change, such as the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the Bangladesh War of Independence in 1971, which had both short-term expected and long-term unexpected outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The speaker describes these intricate relationships as a "[five country cutthroat billiards](geopolitical_strategies_and_historical_conflicts)" game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>.

## Pivotal Decisions Shaping the Playing Field

Several key decisions and situations fundamentally altered the geopolitical landscape:

### 1. China's Conquest of Tibet (Post-1949)
Mao Zedong's decision to reconquer Tibet, which had been autonomous since 1911, was a crucial first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. China's consolidation of control involved extensive road-building between 1950 and 1957, particularly the western route essential for year-round access and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This western route also provided a pincer onto Xinjiang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Impact:** This eliminated the significant buffer zone that Tibet had provided between China and India, reducing it to the small Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. It also brought Chinese and Indian territorial claims into direct conflict, specifically over the Aksai Chin Plateau (taken by China) and Arunachal Pradesh (held by India, claimed by China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### 2. US "Pactomania" and Alliance with Pakistan (Eisenhower Era)
Under President Eisenhower, the US pursued a strategy dubbed "pactomania," forming bilateral and regional alliances to contain the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Baghdad Pact:** This pact involved Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan, aimed at walling off the Soviet Union from Middle Eastern oil fields [[impact_of_oil_on_historical_and_modern_geopolitics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Military Aid to Pakistan:** As a sweetener for joining, the US allied with Pakistan and provided a significant military aid treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Consequences:** Indian Prime Minister Nehru was horrified, stating it changed the balance of power and that US-supplied arms to Pakistan would inevitably be used against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Eisenhower later admitted this was "perhaps the worst kind of plan and decision we could ever have made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This pact poisoned US-India relations for the duration of the Cold War [[cold_war_and_international_alliances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### 3. The Devolving Sino-Soviet Relationship
Tensions between Russia and China escalated throughout this period. Mao, needing Soviet technological aid, initially had to be cautious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, after China detonated an atomic weapon in 1964, Mao became more assertive, claiming the Soviets occupied too much territory, including vast lands taken from the Chinese sphere of influence under the Czars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Mao's Grievances:** Stalin's manipulation of China against Japan, taking Mongolia, fighting "to the last Chinese" in Korea, and seeking a divided China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Ideological clashes with Khrushchev over de-Stalinization and peaceful coexistence also fueled the split [[mao_zedong_as_a_military_and_political_leader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Russian Grievances:** China's refusal to grant Soviet base rights, failure to consult on the Taiwanese Strait crises despite a friendship treaty, and refusal of a combined naval base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Vietnam War:** Both China and Russia sought influence over Vietnam and to prove revolutionary credentials. China hassled Russian aid transiting by train to North Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Sino-Soviet Border Conflict (1969):** Fighting erupted over river islands like on the Amur River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The Russians even approached the US about the possibility of nuking China, which the US rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This event cemented Russia as China's primary adversary, and vice-versa, causing a major reshuffling of global alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Shifting Alignments and Regional Tensions

The term "alliance" is used loosely by the speaker to refer to mutual defense pacts for the purpose of the discussion [[cold_war_and_international_alliances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### India's Strategic Calculations
*   Initially, India pursued non-alignment but felt more in common with Russia due to Fabian socialist economic policies and US segregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. India treated China generously, recognizing it in 1950, refusing to sign the San Francisco Treaty without China and Russia, and recognizing Chinese sovereignty over Tibet in a 1954 friendship treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Sino-Indian War (1962):** Launched by China during the Cuban Missile Crisis, China seized the Aksai Chin Plateau [[sinoindian_and_sinosoviet_relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Nehru felt betrayed by China's "evil for good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This defeat led India to double its army, create mountain divisions, and fostered an enduring anger towards China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. The speaker speculates that a China-India team-up, instead of conflict, could have led to a "completely very different world order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **Post-1962:** India increasingly looked to Russia to counterbalance China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. The relationship was mutually beneficial: Russia offered military/economic aid and UN vetoes (e.g., on Kashmir plebiscites), while India served as a counterweight to China for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. India signed a military pact with Russia in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

### Pakistan's Alliances
*   The US alliance provided military aid, but Pakistan grew wary. Khrushchev threatened Peshawar over U2 flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>, and the US froze arms during the 1965 war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. Ayub Khan accused the US of betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>, and Pakistan canceled the lease for the Badaber listening post in 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **The China Card:** After the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Pakistan saw China as a potential ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. In 1963, Pakistan ceded territory to China, possibly for nuclear development assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Pakistan and China shared India as a common problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

### The United States' Dilemma
The US struggled to navigate South Asian rivalries.
*   Its desire to befriend both India and Pakistan often led to alienating both, as aiding one was perceived as a threat by the other [[indiapakistan_geopolitical_dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   US objectives (countering communism by uniting India and Pakistan against China) clashed with regional realities (India and Pakistan wanting US aid against each other) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   Strategic assets like U2 bases and listening posts in Pakistan (e.g., Badaber) were crucial for surveillance of the Soviet Union pre-satellite imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.
*   Pakistan played a key role in facilitating US diplomatic outreach to China in the early 1970s [[china_and_the_uss_race_in_ai_and_superintelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

## Major Conflicts and Their Repercussions

### Indo-Pakistani War (1965)
Following India's 1962 defeat and Nehru's death in 1964, Pakistan perceived an opportunity to settle border issues, particularly Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. However, India counter-invaded near Lahore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   A US double arms embargo disproportionately affected Pakistan, which was more reliant on US aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   The war ended with the Soviet-brokered Tashkent Declaration, with Pakistan generally worse off and India's military reputation restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

### Bangladesh War of Independence (1971)
This conflict stemmed from Pakistani elections where Bengali representatives from East Pakistan won, leading the Punjabi-dominated West Pakistani military to launch a brutal crackdown in East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.
*   **US Position:** The Nixon administration, focused on opening relations with China (mediated by Pakistan), remained silent on the humanitarian crisis, even blaming India for the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
*   **India's Role:** Faced with millions of refugees, India intervened, arming insurgents and then sending its army into East Pakistan, leading to a swift victory and the creation of Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
*   **Consequences:** Pakistan lost over half its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. Both India and Pakistan intensified their pursuits of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. US-India relations deteriorated further, with India signing a military pact with Russia and restricting US academic access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

## Instruments of National Power in the Cold War

The episode outlines various "plays" or tools used by nations:

*   **Diplomacy:**
    *   Successful: [The US-brokered Indus Waters Treaty](impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society) (1960) between India and Pakistan, providing massive mutual benefit through dam construction, though it yielded no lasting gratitude for the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
    *   Failed: US attempts to get India and Pakistan to settle differences were a "total flop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>, based on false assumptions about their willingness to reconcile or align against China as the US wished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.
    *   Effective when great powers align: The Tashkent Agreement (1965) and the Washington Agreement during the Kargil conflict (1999) showed that when major powers (e.g., US and Russia, or US and China) cooperate, they can de-escalate regional conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
*   **Public Support/Denial:**
    *   The US supported Portugal over India in the Goa dispute due to NATO ties and base access, angering India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.
    *   India often refrained from criticizing Soviet actions (e.g., Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968, Afghanistan 1979) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.
    *   UN Security Council vetoes were a powerful tool, with Russia using them to block Kashmir plebiscites and halt calls against India during the 1971 war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>.
*   **Economic Aid:**
    *   The US provided far more aid than Russia or China, yet India and Pakistan often preferred the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
    *   Significant US aid, like 20% of its wheat crop during the 1967 Bihar famine, failed to generate goodwill due to President Johnson's "ship to mouth" delivery method driven by anger over India's Vietnam stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. Indira Gandhi resolved never to "beg for food again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.
    *   India and Pakistan skillfully played donors against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.
*   **Military Aid:**
    *   Even more difficult to calibrate than economic aid, often having boomerang effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.
    *   US aid to Pakistan drove India towards Russia; US aid to India post-1962 alienated Pakistan, pushing it towards China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.
    *   Aid to Pakistan's ISI to counter Soviets in Afghanistan was diverted to Kashmir, fueling insurgency from 1989 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. This also had "9/11 follow-on effects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Sanctions and Embargoes:**
    *   Frequently used by the US (e.g., during Partition, 1965 war, over nuclear proliferation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
    *   Ultimately failed to stop nuclear proliferation, with India and Pakistan conducting tit-for-tat tests in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.
*   **Funding Insurgencies:**
    *   A common tactic by multiple players (US, Russia, China, India, Pakistan) to pin down adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.
    *   Examples: CIA in Tibet (belatedly and ineffectively) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>; China funding Naga, Mizo, Manipuri, and Naxalite insurgencies in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>; Pakistan in Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>; India allegedly funding Baloch and Pashtun insurgencies in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
    *   **Result: Frozen Conflicts:** These interventions often create "frozen conflicts" (e.g., Kashmir, Korea, Palestine), where external powers pin rivals at the expense of local populations who suffer death, lack of economic growth, and intractable hatreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

## Cold War Lessons and Modern Implications

The episode draws several key lessons from these Cold War interactions relevant to contemporary geopolitics:

### 1. The Primacy of Alignments
*   **Identifying Adversaries:** It's crucial to understand who is the primary adversary of whom, for how long, and for all potential players [[sinoindian_and_sinosoviet_relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. Common existential threats can unite unlikely partners (e.g., WWII Allies against Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>), while shared ideology without a common primary enemy may not lead to cooperation (e.g., WWII Axis powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>).
*   **The US "Swing Position":** The Sino-Soviet split transformed Russia and China into primary adversaries of each other, giving the US a "swing position" to team up with either. The US chose to align with China to overextend Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.
*   **Modern US-India Alignment:** Post-Cold War, US-India relations have improved significantly. With Russia less of a central player for India and China emerging as India's primary adversary, and the US also viewing China as a primary threat, their interests align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

### 2. Perils of Intervention and Aid
*   **Unintended Consequences:** Arming one side in a regional conflict (e.g., US arming Pakistan) often provokes the other side (India) into seeking counter-alliances (with Russia), undermining broader US goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Short-Term vs. Long-Term:** Actions taken for short-term strategic advantage can have severe long-term negative consequences. For instance, US support for Pakistan to counter the Soviets in Afghanistan, while overlooking nuclear proliferation, contributed to Pakistan developing nuclear weapons and fueled regional instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. The decision by the Nixon administration to overlook the genocide in Bangladesh in 1971 to facilitate rapprochement with China is another example of prioritizing one strategic goal with severe humanitarian and regional fallout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>.

### 3. Dynamics of the "Second Cold War"
*   The speaker suggests the world is in a "[second Cold War](cold_war_and_international_alliances)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>.
*   **Sino-Russian Relations:** Despite a current "bromance," historical tensions and divergent long-term interests, particularly concerning Siberia (resource-rich, historically contested, vital water from Lake Baikal for China), suggest this alliance is fragile. The speaker anticipates China will exploit Russian weakness at a convenient moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:30">[01:50:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:28">[01:51:28]</a>.
*   **Importance of International Law:** The speaker emphasizes that the rules-based international order, despite its flaws, is crucial for global stability and prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:06">[01:48:06]</a>. Actions like Putin's in Ukraine, which violate established borders and international law, are dangerous precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>.

### 4. Strategic Maxims
*   **Reassess Assumptions:** Policymakers should constantly reassess their assumptions and not be afraid to change their minds based on new information, viewing it as a sign of strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
*   **Feasibility of Objectives:** Good strategy involves recognizing that some problems may not be feasible to solve, and scarce resources should be focused where they can make a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.
*   **Power Dynamics:** While great powers are influential, smaller and medium powers, if they align, can collectively wield significant influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.
*   **Dictatorships and Information:** Information flow in dictatorships is controlled, making it hard for outsiders (and sometimes their own populace) to understand the reality of their internal situations or flaws (e.g., the appeal of the Soviet model to decolonizing nations partly due to lack of information about gulags and internal issues [[dictatorship_versus_democracy_in_military_decisionmaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>).

The Cold War in South Asia was a complex interplay of global power struggles and regional animosities, leaving a legacy of unresolved conflicts, nuclear proliferation, and shifting alliances that continue to shape the region and the world today.

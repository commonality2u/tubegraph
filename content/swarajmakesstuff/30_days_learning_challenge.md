A personal challenge has been undertaken to learn five to six new programming frameworks or libraries within 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This ambitious goal aims to maximize a semester break and make up for past periods of inactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Motivation Behind the Challenge
The primary [[personal_motivation_and_launching_on_a_special_occasion | personal motivation]] for this challenge stems from having a semester break, with a desire to utilize the time productively rather than having "fun like every other semester break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The individual acknowledges being lazy for the past two years of college, having learned very few things, primarily Next.js and Flutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. While some basics of Flask, SQL, and MongoDB were covered in college, they have since been forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This challenge is an effort to compensate for that past laziness and learn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Prior Learning Experiences
Despite the perceived laziness, the individual has demonstrated a capacity for rapid learning, having learned complete Next.js in just one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, partly due to existing basics from WordPress development before college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Flutter was learned in two weeks about a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The pattern has been to learn "very little for very long time," with long breaks between learning periods, a habit the challenge aims to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Frameworks and Libraries to Master

The challenge outlines a specific set of technologies to learn:

*   **Svelte and SvelteKit:** Chosen due to its significant "hype" and widespread positive reception online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Given prior experience with front-end frameworks like Flutter and React, Svelte is anticipated to take only four to seven days to grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Node.js and Express:** Selected because of the high demand for Node.js jobs, particularly in combination with React, making it a "perfect combination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Express, along with learning REST APIs, is a natural extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **TRPC:** The individual has some prior experience and interest in TRPC, valuing its ability to make applications type-safe, especially from working with the T3 stack (Next.js backend framework) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **MongoDB:** While basic college knowledge exists, the goal is to learn it "whole and through," including its ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) and proper application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Docker:** Essential for deployment and scaling applications, Docker helps create containers for applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistent functionality across different operating systems (e.g., Mac vs. Windows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This is particularly relevant for backend frameworks like Node.js <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Learning Methodology
The learning process for these frameworks will not follow a single, customized path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Instead, it will involve exploring various resources, starting with beginner videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

The core learning strategy involves:
1.  **Binge-Watching Videos:** Watching long (e.g., four-hour) tutorial videos that explain entire frameworks and involve building applications, often at 3x speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This is acknowledged as a "very bad practice" but helps to quickly grasp the overall functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
2.  **Immediate Application Building:** After understanding the general concept, the individual starts building an application without continuous video guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
3.  **Problem-Solving with Resources:** When facing specific problems during development, the individual refers back to the initial video, documentation, or blogs for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This method allows for efficient searching by knowing what functionalities a framework provides, even if the exact code isn't memorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Expected Outcomes and Follow-up
A complete project will be built using the learned frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. While daily progress videos are unlikely due to the nature of the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, a follow-up video will be uploaded after 30 to 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This video will confirm whether the challenge was successful, detail the project idea, and explain the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Overview

A new feature has been developed to connect a GitHub account and automatically generate social media posts based on commits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This tool is designed for developers who wish to [[building_in_public_for_developers | build in public]] and share their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Key Benefits

Having this feature is akin to having a personal assistant, allowing developers to focus on coding while the system creates social media posts for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Users can select specific projects and commits they want to share, and the platform will automatically generate posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Posts can also be edited and customized before publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This solution acts as a [[social_media_management_solutions | social media management solution]] specifically tailored for developers.

## How it Works: A Technical Look

The process involves several steps to ensure relevant and accurate post generation. This provides a [[technical_overview_of_github_integration_for_developers | technical overview of GitHub integration for developers]] for [[automated_social_media_posts_from_github_commits | automated social media posts from GitHub commits]].

### Connecting Your Project

Users first connect their GitHub project or specific repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Once connected, the system monitors changes and pushes to the repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Contextual Understanding

The system also takes into account the project's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This includes understanding the project's purpose, target audience, and planned features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Providing more detailed context helps the system better understand the project and create more effective posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Commit Segregation

Commits are segregated into "important" and "non-important" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This distinction is crucial because not every commit represents a significant feature development; some might be minor style or text changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This segregation helps identify which commits are most suitable for generating meaningful posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### AI-Powered Post Generation

Based on the provided context and the segregated commits, OpenAI APIs are utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The model is fine-tuned with specific prompts geared towards [[building_in_public_for_developers | building in public]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, ensuring the generated posts are relevant and engaging.

## User Experience

### Onboarding and Integration

Upon onboarding, users are prompted to connect their GitHub, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Once connected, users can either directly create posts or connect a new repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Post Creation and Customization

Users can view all commits for a connected repository, select specific ones, and then click a "create post" button to generate content based on their selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. A dedicated section allows users to provide detailed context for their projects through a series of questions, enhancing the quality of generated posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The platform also provides analytics and a dashboard for managing posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Users can edit automatically generated text before publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

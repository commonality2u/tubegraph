A significant personal motivation influenced the timing of the beta launch for Apertures. The developer chose to launch the product on a specific date due to it being his mother's birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:59">[06:10:59]</a>. He extended a public "Happy Birthday Ma" during the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:62">[06:14:62]</a>.

## A Special Launch Date

The decision to launch on this particular day required extra effort, with the developer working overnight to ensure readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:49">[06:17:49]</a>. Despite the landing page not being fully prepared and a different navbar initially planned, he managed to make it work to meet the launch target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:98">[06:20:98]</a>.

## Personal Dedication and Promise

This launch was a fulfillment of a promise made to his mother that he would launch the product by her birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:85">[06:27:85]</a>. His mother had encouraged him to launch quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:39">[06:31:39]</a>. However, the developer specifically wanted to launch *on* her birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:44">[06:34:44]</a>.

## A Gift of Growth

The launch is presented as a gift to his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:09">[06:38:09]</a>. He expressed hope that if the product grows successfully, she would be very happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:57">[06:40:57]</a>. This personal connection underscores the dedication behind the [[beta_launch_of_a_social_media_tool | beta launch of the social media tool]]. The developer also mentioned a desire to "[[the_journey_of_building_a_startup_in_public | build in public]]" while making changes to a post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:64">[04:41:64]</a>.

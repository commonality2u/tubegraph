The development of a [[social_media_management_solutions | social media management solution]] can present significant challenges, ranging from technical architectural decisions to financial constraints for API access.

## Technical Platform Migrations
The project underwent a complete re-architecture between October/November/December and February/March, indicating a period of significant technical flux and refactoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This comprehensive overhaul highlights the [[technical_platform_and_tools_migration | technical platform and tools migration]] challenges inherent in startup development.

Key migrations included:
*   **Router Changes** – Transition from a Pages router to an App router, and then to a Turbo router <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Database Shifts** – Moving from MySQL to Postgres, and then from PlanetScale to Supabase, finally settling on Neon DB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **UI Framework Updates** – Migration from Material Tailwind to Shadcn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **ORM Changes** – Switching from Prisma to Drizzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

While the backend (TRPC) remained consistent, adapting its routes to a new Turbo repo structure was still part of the migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The developer noted that migrating an existing project was more complex than starting a new one from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## API Cost Barriers and User Experience
A significant hurdle in social media integration is the cost associated with accessing platform APIs.
*   **Instagram API** – Connecting Instagram requires official business registration in India, which incurs costs that the developer has postponed due to funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Twitter (X) API** – The cost of the Twitter API is a major barrier, with basic access starting at $100 and scaling up to $48,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Due to these prohibitive costs, users of the application are required to "bring your own API keys" for Twitter functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This requirement is acknowledged as a less-than-ideal user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Funding Challenges
As a "small little developer from India," securing funds is a recurring challenge that directly impacts feature development and API access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The need for funding affects the ability to register the business for Instagram integration and to pay for Twitter API access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Feature Prioritization in MVP Development
The current application is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), meaning not all desired features are fully implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Scheduling** – The scheduling feature for posts is not yet working, but it is planned for future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Team Management Enhancements** – Future plans include adding features like reviews, live documentation, and more comprehensive team management capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. These represent ongoing [[challenges_and_solutions_in_startup_development | challenges and solutions in startup development]] as the product evolves.

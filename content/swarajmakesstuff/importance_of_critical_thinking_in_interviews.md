Critical thinking is a vital skill assessed in many interview processes, particularly in technical roles. A common interview question, famously used by [[google_interview_processes | Google interview processes]], demonstrates the need for efficient problem-solving and optimal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This question involves a puzzle that candidates must solve with the least number of steps, showcasing their ability to think critically and strategically.

## The Puzzle: Finding the Odd Ball

The interview question presents a scenario: you are given eight balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Seven of these balls are of the same weight, while one is of a different (heavier) weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The objective is to identify the odd one out, specifically the heavier ball, using the least number of moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This scenario is a classic [[problemsolving_techniques_for_finding_odd_ball | problem-solving technique]] designed to test a candidate's analytical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Unpacking Solutions: From Inefficient to Optimal

Candidates typically propose various solutions, demonstrating different levels of critical thinking and efficiency in [[strategies_for_minimal_comparison_in_puzzles | minimal comparison in puzzles]].

### Inefficient Approaches

*   **Seven Moves**: A very simple, but inefficient, approach involves comparing one ball to each of the other seven balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This method would inevitably take seven moves to identify the heavier ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Three Moves**: A more common, but still not optimal, solution involves separating the balls into two groups and weighing them to find the heavier group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This process is then repeated, continually dividing the heavier group into two more sub-groups until the odd ball is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While better, this method still requires three moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### The Optimal Two-Move Solution

The most efficient solution, requiring only two moves, highlights strong critical thinking skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

1.  **First Move**: Divide the eight balls into three groups: one group of two balls and two groups of three balls each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Weigh two of the groups of three balls against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   **Scenario A: Groups are equal weight**: If the two groups of three weigh the same, the heavier ball must be in the group of two balls that was set aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Scenario B: One group is heavier**: If one of the groups of three is heavier, then the odd ball is within that group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:34]</a>.
2.  **Second Move**:
    *   **If Scenario A (two balls remaining)**: Take the two balls from the reserved group and weigh them against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The heavier ball is immediately identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   **If Scenario B (three balls remaining)**: From the heavier group of three balls, pick any two balls and weigh them against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
        *   If these two balls are of equal weight, the third ball (which was not weighed) is the heavier one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
        *   If one of the two weighed balls is heavier, that is the odd ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

In all cases, the heavier ball is found in a maximum of two moves, demonstrating a sophisticated application of critical thinking to solve the problem efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Conclusion

This interview question serves as a powerful gauge of a candidate's ability to apply [[problemsolving_techniques_for_finding_odd_ball | problem-solving techniques]] and think critically under pressure. It's not just about finding *an* answer, but the *most optimal* answer, a skill highly valued in many professional environments.

From: [[swarajmakesstuff]] <br/> 

The application allows for the creation of organizations and the invitation of new team members, who can then accept their invitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. Different accounts can be added to a team, each with specific access levels and permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

## Role Types

The system currently supports different roles with varying capabilities:

### Owner
The "owner" of an organization has full control, including the ability to change roles and invite new members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

### Admin
Admins have elevated privileges, including the ability to:
*   Change roles of other team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   Invite new members to the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   Publish content to connected social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

### Editor
Editors have content management capabilities but limited administrative control:
*   **Content Management:** They have access to update and upload posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. They can create or edit content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.
*   **Drafts:** Editors can save content to drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
*   **Social Accounts:** Editors can see and add social accounts for the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   They cannot edit administrative settings such as changing roles or inviting new members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
    *   Editors cannot publish posts directly to social media; this action is reserved for admins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.
    *   They cannot publish content to social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>, nor can they publish to the organization's social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

### Member (View-Only)
Members with a view-only role have the most restricted access:
*   **Viewing:** They can only view content and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Limitations:** They cannot edit posts or add new members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. They are limited to a "preview" function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

## Future Enhancements
Future plans include adding features for reviews, live documentation reviews, and more comprehensive team management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

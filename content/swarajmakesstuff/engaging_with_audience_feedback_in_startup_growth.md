Swaraj, a tech enthusiast and startup founder, has launched a YouTube channel primarily to [[the_journey_of_building_a_startup_in_public | share the journey of his startup publicly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. A core aspect of this initiative is to engage directly with his audience, seeking feedback and fostering a mutual learning environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Role of Audience Feedback

The channel aims to cover various aspects of startup development, including [[challenges_and_solutions_in_startup_development | problems faced and solutions found]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, as well as the [[technical_aspects_and_ideation_process_in_startups | technology and ideation process]] behind the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A key objective for Swaraj is to "get your feedback and want to learn more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. He believes that by sharing the journey of his startup on social media, he can gain valuable insights from his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Mutual Learning and Teaching

Swaraj envisions the YouTube channel as a "two side transaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. He states, "I will learn from you, I'll take feedback from you and you will learn from me as well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. His goal is to "learn more while teaching" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, sharing what he learns regularly, including tips on technologies like Next.js app router models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Overview of the Startup

The startup is an AI automation software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It targets three main niches: developers, creators, and social media marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The core problem it addresses is the challenge of consistently posting on social media while focusing on primary work or products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The startup aims to simplify the process of establishing an online presence, enabling users to manage a week's worth of content posting within one or two hours, utilizing AI and various other features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The platform goes beyond basic content creation offered by tools like ChatGPT, promising unique and extensive features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The technology stack used for the startup is T3 Stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Future Engagement

Swaraj plans to share videos every one to two weeks, detailing the progress, features, and ideas for the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This ongoing public sharing is a key component of his [[building_in_public_for_developers | building in public]] strategy, designed to continuously integrate audience feedback into the [[startup_evolution_and_progress | startup's evolution and progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The speaker has undertaken a 30-day challenge to learn several new [[frontend_and_backend_frameworks | frameworks]] and libraries, focusing on broadening their skills beyond just frontend development. This challenge aims to make up for previous laziness and maximize a semester break [00:28:40].

## Why Learn Backend Frameworks?

While the speaker has prior experience with [[frontend_and_backend_frameworks | frontend frameworks]] like Next.js and Flutter, a strong need for backend skills was identified, especially when looking for jobs [03:48:51]. Many frontend positions require at least some backend knowledge [03:51:00].

## Node.js and Express

Node.js is chosen as a backend framework due to its prevalence in the job market [03:46:25]. It forms a "perfect combination" with React [04:19:22]. Learning Node.js inherently includes learning Express.js, which is used for building REST APIs [04:26:40].

## MongoDB

MongoDB is identified as a database to learn more thoroughly [04:54:27]. The speaker knows the basics from college but aims to understand it "whole and through" [04:57:48], including its ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) and proper application [05:04:11].

## Complementary Technologies

### TRPC
The speaker also plans to learn TRPC, having some prior exposure to it and an appreciation for making applications type-safe [04:36:10]. TRPC was encountered while working with the T3 stack, which integrates Next.js [04:42:00].

### Docker
Docker is included in the learning plan to containerize applications [05:21:40]. Docker helps create containers that bundle the application, its dependencies, and the environment, facilitating easy scaling and deployment on the web [05:34:40]. It also addresses issues where code might malfunction or function differently across various operating systems, like Mac and Windows, especially with Python libraries [06:03:00]. Docker will be used to containerize the Node.js application to simplify deployment [06:32:00].

## Learning Strategy

The speaker's learning approach for these [[frontend_and_backend_frameworks | frameworks]] involves:
*   Binge-watching long beginner videos (e.g., 4-hour videos) at 3x speed to quickly grasp the overall functionality of the framework [07:52:00].
*   Starting to build an application without constantly referring to videos [08:14:00].
*   Consulting documentation or blogs when encountering specific problems or needing to understand how to implement particular features [08:16:00].
*   The initial "binge-watch" step helps the brain understand what is possible with the framework, even if the specific code isn't memorized, making subsequent searches for solutions more efficient [08:29:00].

This article details the journey of a startup founder building an AI automation software and sharing the process publicly through a YouTube channel. The initiative aims to provide insights into startup development, gather community feedback, and teach technical skills.

## The Public Journey
The founder, a tech enthusiast and startup founder, intends to share the journey of their startup publicly on a YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This includes sharing the [[challenges_and_solutions_in_startup_development | problems faced and solutions found]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, the [[technical_aspects_and_ideation_process_in_startups | technology behind it]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, and the [[technical_aspects_and_ideation_process_in_startups | ideation process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The objective is to document the [[startup_evolution_and_progress | different steps]] taken in the startup's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Mutual Learning and Feedback
A core goal of sharing this journey publicly is to [[engaging_with_audience_feedback_in_startup_growth | receive feedback]] and foster a learning environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The founder aims to learn more while also teaching what they have learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This is viewed as a "two-sided transaction" where the founder learns from the audience's feedback, and the audience learns from the shared experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

> "I will learn from you, I'll take feedback from you, and you will learn from me as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>

## The Startup: AI Automation Software
The startup is an AI automation software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Target Audience
The software targets three primary niches:
*   Developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   Creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   Social media marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

### Problem Solved
The startup addresses the challenge many individuals and businesses face in maintaining an online presence and consistently posting on social media while focusing on their core work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The software aims to simplify and ease the process of sharing one's journey and building an online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Solution
The software helps users create content for a whole week by dedicating only one to two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It leverages AI and various features to streamline the content creation and posting process for social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The founder emphasizes that it's not a simple AI like ChatGPT that provides generic or "bot-like" posts; it offers a long list of features beyond basic content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Technical Aspects
The startup is developed using the T3 Stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Future Plans for Public Sharing
The founder plans to share a video every one to two weeks, detailing the progress, features, and ideas related to the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
